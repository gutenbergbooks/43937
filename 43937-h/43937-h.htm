<h1 title="">FINDING THE LOST TREASURE</h1>
<h2 id="c1"><br />CHAPTER I
<br />A MYSTERIOUS PAPER</h2>
<p>&ldquo;W-17<sup>55</sup>-15x12-6754,&rdquo; read Desir&eacute; slowly.
&ldquo;What <i>does</i> it mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does what mean, Dissy?&rdquo; asked her
younger sister, who was rolling a ball across the
floor to little Ren&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just some figures on an old paper I found,
dear. I must tell Jack about them. Do you
know where he is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out there somewhere, I guess,&rdquo; replied the
child, with a vague gesture indicating the front
yard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>Desir&eacute; flung back her short dark curls and
crossed the room to a window where sturdy
geraniums raised their scarlet clusters to the
very top of the panes. It was the custom in
that part of Nova Scotia to make a regular
screen of blossoming plants in all front windows,
sometimes even in those of the cellar.
Peering between two thick stems, she could see
her older brother sitting on the doorstep,
gazing out across St. Mary&rsquo;s Bay which lay
like a blue, blue flag along the shore.</p>
<p>Crossing the narrow hall and opening the
outside door, Desir&eacute; dropped down beside the
boy and thrust a time-yellowed slip of paper
into his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied slowly. &ldquo;A few days before
he died, <i>n&ocirc;tre p&egrave;re</i> went over the contents
of his tin box with me to make sure that I
understood all about the bills, and the mortgage
on the farm and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mortgage!&rdquo; exclaimed Desir&eacute; in shocked
tones. &ldquo;I never knew we had one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, either, until that day. You see <i>n&ocirc;tre m&egrave;re</i>
was sick so long that all our little savings were
used up, and ready money was an absolute
necessity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did he tell you about this?&rdquo; continued
the girl, after a thoughtful pause, running
her finger along the line of tantalizing
characters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing very definite. He said it was a
memorandum of some kind that had been
handed down in our family for generations.
The name of its writer, and its meaning, have
been lost in the past; but each father passed it
on to his eldest son, with a warning to preserve
it most carefully, for it was valuable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now it belongs to you,&rdquo; concluded
Desir&eacute;, half sadly, half proudly.</p>
<p>Jack nodded, and for several moments
neither spoke.</p>
<p>John Wistmore, aged 18, Desir&eacute;, 14, Priscilla,
9, and Ren&eacute;, 5, were direct descendants of John
Alden and Priscilla Mullins, whose story the
poet Longfellow tells in <i>The Courtship of Miles
Standish</i>.</p>
<p>The little town of Sissiboo, an Indian corruption
of <i>Six Hiboux</i><a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>
where they lived, is one of
those settled by the Acadians upon their return
to the land of their birth some years after the
expulsion. So closely, so ramblingly are the villages
strung along the shores of St. Mary&rsquo;s Bay
on the northwest coast of Nova Scotia that it
is hard to tell where one ends and the next begins.
Their inhabitants live exactly as did
their ancestors, speaking French and preserving
with care all the old habits and customs.</p>
<div class="fnblock"><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_1" href="#fr_1">[1]</a><span class="small">SIX OWLS.</span>
</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>The lives of the children had been simple,
happy ones, until the recent death of their
father and mother, hardly three months apart.
John Wistmore, in whose veins flowed the blood
of men of culture and ambition, had been
anxious to give his children greater educational
advantages than Sissiboo afforded. Jack, therefore,
had been sent to Wolfville to school, and
was now ready for college; while Desir&eacute; was
looking forward to high school in the autumn.
Now all was changed. Without relatives, without
money, and without prospects, they faced
the problem of supporting the two younger
children and themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you find this?&rdquo; asked Jack,
rousing himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the floor in front of the cupboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have slipped from the box when I
took out the mortgage. I went over it with
Nicolas Bouchard this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, does he hold it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wants his money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what can we do? We can&rsquo;t possibly
pay him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, I guess, dear, except let him foreclose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would we get any money at all, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very little. Not enough to live on, certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew what these mean,&rdquo; she sighed
wistfully, touching the paper still between her
brother&rsquo;s fingers. &ldquo;If we could only find out,
maybe we&rsquo;d get enough money to pay Nicolas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack laughed in spite of his anxiety. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
afraid we&rsquo;d all starve before they could be
interpreted. Too bad, as things have gone, that
I didn&rsquo;t farm as soon as I was old enough&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that! We&rsquo;ll hope and plan for
your college course&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Desir&eacute;, dear,&rdquo; protested her brother, gently
but firmly, &ldquo;it is absolutely out of the question,
even to think of such a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Jack, every one should have some
special goal in life, as an incentive if nothing
else; and I&rsquo;m <i>not</i> going to give up planning for
our education. One never knows when good
fortune is waiting just around the next corner
to complete one&rsquo;s own efforts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess <i>our</i> goal will be to provide food and
clothing for the children. I&rsquo;m afraid it will be
a hard pull for you and me to keep the family
together&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but we <i>must</i> stay together, Jack,&rdquo; she
cried, grasping his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As far as I can see,&rdquo; he continued slowly,
&ldquo;the only thing to be done is to move to Halifax
or Yarmouth, where I could get work of
some kind. Should you mind very much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever you decide, I&rsquo;ll be willing to do,&rdquo;
replied the girl bravely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If it will make you any happier,&rdquo; continued
Jack, giving her one of his grave, sweet smiles,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll place higher education among our day
dreams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you folks ain&rsquo;t hungry, we are!&rdquo; announced
Priscilla, opening the door behind
them so suddenly that both jumped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see?&rdquo; laughed Jack, as he pulled
Desir&eacute; up from the low step.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just had a wonderful inspiration
though,&rdquo; she whispered as they entered the
hall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><br />CHAPTER II
<br />DESIR&Eacute;&rsquo;S INSPIRATIONS</h2>
<p>It was a quaint old room in which they
settled down after supper had been eaten and
the children put to bed. The woodwork was
painted a deep blue, known as Acadian blue,
and the floor was bare except for a couple of
oval braided rugs in which the same color predominated.
In the center of the room stood a
hutch table, one that can be changed to a chest
by reversing its hinged top. Around it were
half a dozen high-backed chairs, their seats
made of strips of deerskin woven in and out
like the paper mats made in kindergartens. A
spinning wheel stood beside the fireplace, before
which sat Jack and Desir&eacute;, with no other
light except that of the dancing flames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now Dissy,&rdquo; said the boy, laying his hand
affectionately over hers, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s have the inspiration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this: that we stay on here as tenants.
Nicolas can&rsquo;t live in this house and his own
too!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But one trouble with that plan is that Nicolas
wants to sell the property and get his money
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;d buy it? Nobody ever moves into or
out of this town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has a customer now. Andr&eacute; Comeau&rsquo;s
prospective father-in-law wants to move here
after the wedding. He can&rsquo;t bear to have Marie
live so far away from him. Sorry to spoil your
inspiration, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desir&eacute; made no reply; for she was very close
to tears, and she hated to act like a baby instead
of the good pal her brother had always
called her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to work on Andr&eacute;&rsquo;s house
again tomorrow,&rdquo; observed Jack presently.
&ldquo;The roof&rsquo;s on, the floors laid, and by Saturday
we should be able to start the barn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In New Acadia all the relatives, friends, and
neighbors of a man who is about to be married
join in building a new house for him. They
clear a piece of land, haul materials, and labor
for weeks on the construction of house, barn,
and sheds. When these are finished, the garden
is prepared, the fields ploughed and planted,
and the buildings furnished. The bride-to-be
contributes linens, and her people stock the
farm with animals. Some morning the whole
countryside walks to church to see the couple
wedded, returning to the home of the bride&rsquo;s
mother, where the day is spent in feasting and
merry-making. If the groom can afford it, he
then takes his bride to Yarmouth to spend a
few days at the Grand Hotel. That is the
greatest ambition of every rustic pair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>Jack talked on quietly about the house raising
until he saw that his sister had recovered her
composure. She was smiling bravely as he
kissed her goodnight, but her sleep was broken
by feverish dreams of the worn slip of paper,
and a long journey.</p>
<p>When Jack returned at dusk the following
evening, after a long day&rsquo;s work on Andr&eacute;&rsquo;s
house, he found Desir&eacute; waiting for him with
sparkling eyes, flushed face, and such an air of
repressed excitement that he wondered what
had happened while he had been away.</p>
<p>It was necessary to wait until the children
had gone to bed before he could question her.
They had decided it was best to leave the
younger ones out of discussions of ways and
means. &ldquo;Let them be carefree as long as they
can,&rdquo; Desir&eacute; had urged, and Jack had agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who do you suppose was here today?&rdquo; she
asked, perching on the arm of his chair as soon
as they were alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never could guess,&rdquo; he replied, slipping his
arm around her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Simon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Starting his spring trip early, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather. I made him stay to dinner, and we
talked and talked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Simon drove one of the big covered wagons
which are common in Nova Scotia. They have
double doors at the back, and are filled with all
kinds of groceries and notions, a regular general
store on wheels. Many parts of the country
are so thinly settled that it would be impossible
for people to obtain certain supplies without
the existence of these interesting wagons. Some
of them specialize in certain things, like ready-to-wear
clothing, but most of them carry a little
of everything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he have anything interesting to tell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The proprietors of these odd stores act as
relayers of bits of news, as well as merchandise,
and often bear messages from one part of the
peninsula to the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;why&mdash;I don&rsquo;t&mdash;really know,&rdquo; faltered
Desir&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; repeated her brother, turning
to look at her in surprise; for although she
dearly loved her home, she was always eager
for contacts with the outside world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, we talked business all the
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Business?&rdquo; he queried, more and more
puzzled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Oh, Jack, let <i>us</i> get a wagon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Desir&eacute;, you must be crazy!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
startled out of his usual calm of manner and
speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not really. Just listen a minute,&rdquo;
telling off the points on her fingers. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d be
all together. We&rsquo;d be earning an honest living,
and having a lot of fun, and seeing places; and
it&rsquo;s healthful to be out-of-doors, a lot; and&mdash;&rdquo;
she paused for breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Dissy,&rdquo; protested her brother gently,
&ldquo;we couldn&rsquo;t live in the wagon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, we could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of us? Day and night?&rdquo; asked the boy,
troubled at this odd notion that had evidently
so strongly taken possession of his hitherto
sensible sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could have a little tent for you and Ren&eacute;
at night. Prissy and I could easily sleep in
the wagon. It would be no different from camping,
Jack; and lots of people do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about winter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course we couldn&rsquo;t live that way
after it gets real cold, but winter&rsquo;s a long way
off. Maybe we&rsquo;d make enough by then to rent
a couple of rooms in some central place and
take just day trips. Or perhaps we&rsquo;ll find out
what that paper means, and have&mdash;who knows
what?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>Jack shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seriously, Desir&eacute;, I don&rsquo;t see how we can
make a living from a traveling store. Simon
does, of course; but there is only one of him,
and four of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; resumed the girl, after a short pause,
&ldquo;we have no place to go if Nicolas forecloses;
we don&rsquo;t know how else to support ourselves;
so wouldn&rsquo;t traveling around the country all
summer give us a chance to see all kinds of
places and people? Mightn&rsquo;t we get in touch
with possibilities for the future? Our living
expenses would be small; for we could gather
wild things to eat&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few bears, or owls, I suppose,&rdquo; laughed
her brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, silly! Berries, and&mdash;and grapes, and
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavy diet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And fish,&rdquo; concluded Desir&eacute; triumphantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another thing,&rdquo; continued Jack, resuming
his gravity, &ldquo;you wouldn&rsquo;t want to spoil old
Simon&rsquo;s route by taking some of his customers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not, but there certainly must be
sections where there is no traveling store. We
could take one of those.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then a heavy knock on the front door
startled them both.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><br />CHAPTER III
<br />TWO CALLERS</h2>
<p>When Jack opened the door, Nicolas
Bouchard stood frowning before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come in, Nicolas,&rdquo; he urged hospitably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t; it&rsquo;s too late; but saw you were still
up, and wanted to tell you that I just had a
message from Yves and he wants to take possession
of this place at once. Think you could
be out by this day week?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know we aren&rsquo;t going to pay
off the mortgage?&rdquo; flashed Desir&eacute;, annoyed at
the man for taking things so for granted.</p>
<p>Nicolas gave a grunt. &ldquo;What with? Don&rsquo;t
get mad. We all know you haven&rsquo;t got any
money. Glad to have you pay if you could, for
you&rsquo;ve always been good neighbors; but a
man&rsquo;s got to take care of his pennies. They&rsquo;re
not so plentiful now as they were when I took
that mortgage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, Nicolas,&rdquo; said Jack, quietly laying
a restraining hand on Desir&eacute;&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;You
may have the house a week from today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man lingered rather awkwardly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Felice said she&rsquo;d be willing to keep the two
little ones, so as you and this girl could go to
Boston, and find work&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desir&eacute; started to speak, but Jack&rsquo;s hold on
her arm tightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They pay good wages there, I&rsquo;m told,&rdquo; the
man went on. &ldquo;Or, if you could find some place
for the rest, Yves said he&rsquo;d be glad to have you
stay on here and help him farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are indeed grateful for the kindness of
our friends,&rdquo; replied Jack; &ldquo;but we have
decided that we must all stick together, some
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicolas turned without another word, and
strode down the shell-bordered path to the road,
and Jack closed the door. In silent dismay the
brother and sister faced each other; then the
girl&rsquo;s courage reasserted itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, dear,&rdquo; she cried, putting both
arms around him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll surely find something.
As <i>n&ocirc;tre m&egrave;re</i> used to say so often, &lsquo;let&rsquo;s
sleep on it.&rsquo; Things always look lots brighter
in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re such a good little pal, Dissy. We&rsquo;ll
say an extra prayer tonight for help, and tomorrow
we&rsquo;ll try to decide upon something
definite.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>Late the following afternoon Desir&eacute; stood on
the doorstep, watching Priscilla hopping down
the dusty road to see a little friend. Early that
morning Jack had gone to Meteghan to settle
up affairs with Nicolas and Yves, and, to please
Desir&eacute;, to price an outfit for a traveling store.
The sisters, greatly hindered by Ren&eacute;, had
spent the day going over keepsakes and household
belongings of all kinds, trying to decide
what they would keep and what they must dispose
of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to sell <i>all</i> our things, Dissy?
Even Mother&rsquo;s chair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so, dear. You see we can&rsquo;t carry
furniture around with us when we don&rsquo;t know
where or how we are going to live. You have
her little silver locket for a keepsake, and I
have her prayerbook. We really don&rsquo;t need
anything to remember her by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; and Jack has <i>n&ocirc;tre p&egrave;re&rsquo;s</i> watch. But,
oh, I&mdash;I wish we weren&rsquo;t going. I&rsquo;m sort of
afraid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid!&rdquo; chided Desir&eacute;, although her own
heart was filled with the nameless dread which
often accompanies a contemplated change.
&ldquo;With dear old Jack to take care of us? I&rsquo;m
ashamed of you! We&rsquo;re going to have just lots
of good times together. Try not to let Jack
know that you mind. Remember, Prissy, it&rsquo;s far
harder on him to be obliged to give up all his
own plans and hopes to take care of us, than it
is for you and me to make some little sacrifices
and pretend we like them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ye-es,&rdquo; agreed Priscilla slowly, trying to
measure up to what was expected of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with Prissy?&rdquo; demanded
Ren&eacute;, deserting his play and coming to stand
in front of them. &ldquo;Has she got a pain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A kind of one,&rdquo; replied Desir&eacute; gently, &ldquo;but
it&rsquo;s getting better now; so go on with what you
were doing, darling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child returned to the corner of the room
where he had been making a wagon from spools
and a pasteboard box, while Priscilla murmured,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try not to fuss about things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a brave girl,&rdquo; commended her sister.
&ldquo;Now, you&rsquo;ve been in all day; so suppose
you run down to see Felice for a little while.
Maybe you&rsquo;ll meet Jack on the way home, but
don&rsquo;t wait for him later than half past five.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little girl was almost out of sight when
Desir&eacute;&rsquo;s attention was diverted to the opposite
direction by the sound of an automobile, apparently
coming from Digby. Motor cars were still
sufficiently new in Nova Scotia to excuse her
waiting to see it pass. Only the well-to-do
people owned them, and she had never even had
a ride in one. There were rumors that possibly
that very summer a bus line would be run to
the various interesting parts of the country for
the convenience of tourists from the States.
Then she might be able to ride a little way,
if it didn&rsquo;t cost too much, just to see how it felt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>A ramshackle Ford jerked to a sudden halt
right in front of the house, and a tall, thin man
backed carefully out from the driver&rsquo;s seat and
ambled up the path toward her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle Wistmore?&rdquo; he inquired,
bashfully removing his blue woolen cap and
thrusting it under his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Oui</i>, Monsieur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Pierre Boisdeau,&rdquo; he drawled,
taking the cap out from under his arm and rolling
it nervously between his two big hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; replied Desir&eacute; encouragingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a message for you,&rdquo; pushing the
long-suffering cap into his pocket as he spoke.</p>
<p>The girl seated herself upon the broad stone
step, and with a gesture invited the stranger
to do the same; but he merely placed one foot
upon the scraper beside the step, and began in
halting embarrassed fashion to deliver his
message.</p>
<p>After he had gone, Desir&eacute; fairly raced
through preparations for supper; then went to
look up the road again. If Jack would only
come! Ren&eacute; trudged around from the back of
the house where he had been playing, and announced
that he was hungry; so she took him
in, gave him his supper, and put him to bed.
Before she had finished, Priscilla returned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jack must have been delayed somewhere.
We might as well eat, and I&rsquo;ll get his supper
when he comes,&rdquo; decided the older girl.</p>
<p>While they ate, Priscilla chattered on and on
about her playmates, while Desir&eacute; said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;
and &ldquo;No&rdquo; rather absent-mindedly. Where
could Jack be?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to bed,&rdquo; yawned Priscilla, about
seven o&rsquo;clock. &ldquo;We ran so much, I&rsquo;m tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are <i>you</i> going?&rdquo; inquired the child,
stopping on the stairs as she caught sight of her
sister throwing a shawl around her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only out to the road to watch for Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t go any farther, and leave us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. Have I ever left you alone
at night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No-o-o.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run along to bed then,&rdquo; reaching up to pat
the brown hand which grasped the stair railing.</p>
<p>What was keeping Jack?</p>
<p>For half an hour Desir&eacute; shifted her weight
from one foot to the other, watching the darkening
road. As soon as she spied his tall form, she
ran to meet him and fell into step at his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be nearly starved, dear,&rdquo; she
began.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit. I happened to be at Henry
Simard&rsquo;s at about supper time, and nothing
would do but I must stay and eat with them. I
hope you weren&rsquo;t worried,&rdquo; looking down at
Desir&eacute; anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried not to be; for I thought perhaps you
had gone farther than you intended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nicolas was ready when I got to his house,
and Yves met us in Meteghan; so we fixed
everything up successfully. The money which
came to us I put into the bank for emergencies;
for&mdash;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry to have to tell you&mdash;there
isn&rsquo;t enough to buy and stock up a wagon,
even if we decided to adopt that way of living.
So I looked around a bit for some kind of a
job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you find anything?&rdquo; asked Desir&eacute;, a
bit breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet; but I shall. We could&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now that I&rsquo;ve heard your news,&rdquo; interrupted
the girl eagerly, &ldquo;just listen to mine.
A man named Pierre Boisdeau came in an auto
from Digby this afternoon with a message for
us. Oh, Jack, the most wonderful thing! When
he took some salmon down to Yarmouth the
other day, they told him at the docks that old
Simon had sent word to be sure to have anyone
from up this way go to see him. So he went,
and found the poor old man all crippled up with
rheumatism. He will have to stay at his
daughter&rsquo;s house all summer. So he won&rsquo;t be
able to peddle. And Jack! He wants <i>us</i> to
take his wagon! Isn&rsquo;t that just glorious? He
said that if we won&rsquo;t take it and keep the route
for him until he is well again, he&rsquo;ll likely have
to sell out. He doesn&rsquo;t want to do that. Isn&rsquo;t it
just providential? This will give us a chance to
try the experiment without much expense, and
will provide for us for several months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are indeed very fortunate,&rdquo; replied
Jack gravely. &ldquo;We could hardly take such an
offer from anyone else, but Simon is such an old
friend that he would feel hurt if we refused.
As you say, it will give us a chance to find a
place to settle in permanently. In the meantime,
we shall be holding the route for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They entered the house and dropped down
beside the table, still covered with dishes, to
finish their talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simon wants an answer as soon as possible;
for he hates to think of all his customers being
deserted for so long. You&rsquo;d better write to him
tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said Jack slowly, after a few
minutes&rsquo; consideration during which his sister
scanned his serious, thoughtful face rather
anxiously. &ldquo;I wonder if it would be better for
me to go down alone to get the wagon and pick
you up on the way back; or, for all of us to
ride to Yarmouth on the train, and start the
route from there. Which should you like
better?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To go to Yarmouth, of course; but won&rsquo;t it
cost a lot more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can prepare enough food for us to carry
two meals, and there must be some place where
we could camp just outside of the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anxious to get started?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I hate goodbyes. I&rsquo;d like to steal out
right away, without anybody knowing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you can&rsquo;t leave our good neighbors
like that. They have known us all our
lives; and think how hurt they would feel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so; but they all want us to do
something different, and criticize <i>n&ocirc;tre p&egrave;re</i> for
trying to educate us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t understand, but they mean well
and have been very kind to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, and I do appreciate it; but&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t
we start soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Day after tomorrow, I should think. I&rsquo;m
afraid one trunk and the box in the store room
will be all we can take on our travels. Shall
you be able to manage that way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to; but what shall I do with the
furniture?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Give it away, or leave it for Yves. We&rsquo;ll
just have to stifle all sentimental affection for
our household gods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a house of our own again some
day, and get new household gods.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Intense excitement prevailed in the Clare
District on Wednesday afternoon. Little groups
of women and children were hurrying along
the dusty road. On every doorstep a man or
woman too old, or a child too young, to join
the procession was sitting waiting to wave farewell
to the travelers when they passed. These
good people were much disturbed at the departure
of the little Wistmore family. It was
almost unheard of for any of the Acadian families
voluntarily to leave that peaceful section
and wander among strangers in unfamiliar
parts of the country. Occasionally, within their
knowledge, an individual or two had decided
to seek his fortune elsewhere; but never before
a whole family, and the Wistmores at that!
The neighbors had done their best, one and
all, to dissuade the children from following
such a course; but since their words of advice
and warning had proved of no avail, they were
now on their way, bearing little gifts of good
will, to bid the adventurers Godspeed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>When Jack drove up with Andr&eacute; Comeau
who was going to take them to the station, three
miles away, the yard was filled with little
groups of neighbors; and inside the house still
others were saying their reluctant farewells.
Shaking the hands held out to him on every
side, Jack gently pushed through the crowd;
and, with Andr&eacute;&rsquo;s help, loaded their one trunk
and box onto the wagon. Then he detached
Desir&eacute; and the children from the weeping
women, and helped them up to the seats which
had been made of rough planks laid across the
wagon box. The crowd drew back, and amid
a chorus of &ldquo;<i>Bon jour!</i>&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Au revoir!</i>&rdquo; the
travelers started on their journey.</p>
<p>Desir&eacute; and Priscilla, with tears rolling down
their faces, waved as long as they could see
their old friends, and answered salutations
from many a doorstep; but Jack, with set face,
did not look back at all. Even Ren&eacute; was unusually
quiet, hardly knowing what to make of
it all. The train pulled into the tiny station
just as they reached the platform, and there
was no time to be lost. Before the children,
to whom a railroad was a novelty, had time
hardly to glance at the long train, its freight
cars placed ahead of the coaches, as is common
in Nova Scotia, they were hustled on board, the
bell rang, and they were off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><br />CHAPTER IV
<br />OUT TO SEA</h2>
<p>The little party was very quiet during the
ride, which took two hours. The older members
were occupied with their own thoughts,
very serious ones, and the young pair engrossed
in looking out of the window.</p>
<p>Rolling rocky land; woods where sombre and
stately pines and firs made a fitting background
for the graceful slender white trunks of the
birch trees; miles of ferns close to the tracks;
tiny stations; glimpses, between the trees, of
rustic dwellings and a few more pretentious
summer homes; flashes of wild flowers; rivers,
down whose red mud banks still trickled
threads of water, although the tide was out;
grey farm buildings; all flowed rapidly past.
Then&mdash;Yarmouth!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay right here,&rdquo; directed Jack, after they
had alighted from the train, leading the way
to a pile of crates on the platform, &ldquo;until I
check our baggage. I thought we&rsquo;d keep only
the night bag, and pick up the rest after we
get the wagon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>Before the children had tired of watching
the passers-by, he was back again, and they
walked slowly toward the centre of the city,
not pausing until they reached the tiny park
facing the wharf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and the children had better sit here
while I go to find out the location of the street
where Simon&rsquo;s daughter lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the <i>Grand Hotel</i>, where Andr&eacute;
brought Marie after the wedding?&rdquo; asked Priscilla,
looking up in admiration at the big building
across the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just think!&rdquo; cried the child ecstatically,
giving a little skip, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really looking at the
place I&rsquo;ve heard of so many times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, your education has begun,&rdquo; said
Jack. &ldquo;See that you make the most of all your
opportunities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a very funny place,&rdquo; observed Priscilla,
looking around her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a park&mdash;&rdquo; began Desir&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look at those,&rdquo; interrupted the younger
girl, pointing to several graves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been used as a cemetery first,&rdquo;
replied her sister, walking over to read the inscription
on a nearby stone, and closely
followed by Priscilla. That moment or two
gave Ren&eacute; the chance for which he had longed,
and he was off down the road and onto the
wharf. Desir&eacute; turned to look for him just in
time to see a little blue-clad figure dart across
the gang plank of the Boston steamer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ren&eacute;!&rdquo; she called in desperation, racing
toward the dock.</p>
<p>The tug which helped the steamer pull away
from her slip was already out in the harbor;
bells were ringing, the whistle was blowing,
dock hands were running about. Across the
gang plank ran Desir&eacute; and Priscilla just before
it was withdrawn, and the ropes were cast off.
As they looked helplessly among the crowds
of people and piles of luggage for the truant,
the tug was steadily pulling on the long tow
line, and heading the steamer out to sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My&mdash;little&mdash;brother,&rdquo; gasped Desir&eacute; to an
officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about him?&rdquo; demanded the busy man
curtly.</p>
<p>His brisk manner was just enough, in her
distressed state of mind, to reduce the girl
immediately to tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He got away from us and is on this boat.
That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s about him,&rdquo; said Priscilla, coming
at once to her sister&rsquo;s aid. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind,
Dissy; we&rsquo;ll find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An interested spectator of the scene, a tall,
energetic type of woman, now joined the group.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let me help you look for him, my dear,&rdquo;
she said briskly, putting a hand on Desir&eacute;&rsquo;s
shoulder. &ldquo;No need to worry; he&rsquo;s certainly
safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; choked the girl, now fully conscious
that the boat was moving, &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t go on.
My big brother is waiting for us in Yarmouth!
What&mdash;what will he think? What will he <i>do</i>?&rdquo;
She wrung her hands distractedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could go back on the tug, if the boy&rsquo;s
found before she leaves us,&rdquo; suggested the
officer, coming to the rescue as soon as he fully
understood the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he is!&rdquo; shrieked Priscilla, darting
to the side of the boat where Ren&eacute; was climbing
up on a suitcase to look over the railing
at the water. Grasping him firmly by the tail
of his jacket, she dragged him backward across
the salon, and brought him to a violent sitting
posture at Desir&eacute;&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the officer had ordered the tug to
be signalled, and she now came alongside. No
time for anything but hurried thanks to their
benefactors as the girls and Ren&eacute; were helped
over the side and onto the tug. Noisily, fussily,
she steamed away from the big boat, over
whose rails hung the interested passengers, and
headed to Yarmouth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What ever made you do such a naughty
thing, Ren&eacute;?&rdquo; asked Desir&eacute;, who had recovered
her outward composure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wanted to see big boat,&rdquo; replied the child,
not at all impressed by the gravity of his
offense. Useless to say more now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young feller needs a good whaling,&rdquo;
growled the pilot of the tug, as he brought his
boat alongside the wharf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Jack!&rdquo; cried Desir&eacute;, in great relief,
catching sight of him striding rapidly
along the street above the docks. &ldquo;Jump out,
quickly, Prissy! Run up and tell him we&rsquo;re all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child sprang to the dock and ran up
the incline at top speed, while Desir&eacute; lingered
to thank the pilot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to do it, ma&rsquo;moiselle. Better keep
hold of him hereafter, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall,&rdquo; she promised, with a reproachful
look at Ren&eacute;.</p>
<p>The reunited family met in the little park,
and sat down on one of the benches to readjust
themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, dear,&rdquo; said Desir&eacute;, putting
her hand in Jack&rsquo;s. &ldquo;You must have been
frantic.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t believe my eyes when I came
back and found that you had all disappeared.
An old dock hand who saw me looking around
said he&rsquo;d seen a boy, followed by two girls,
go aboard the &lsquo;Yarmouth.&rsquo; So, knowing Ren&eacute;,
I came to a close solution of the mystery. I
was just going up to the steamship office to
see what could be done when Prissy grabbed
me from behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ren&eacute;,&rdquo; he went on, placing the child directly
in front of him so he could look into his
eyes, &ldquo;you have been a <i>very</i> bad boy; and only
the fact that we are out here in a public place
prevents me from putting you right across my
knee, and giving you something to make you
remember your naughtiness. There is to be <i>no</i>
more running away. Do you understand me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little boy, wiggling slightly as if he already
felt the punishment, nodded gravely, impressed
by his brother&rsquo;s stern face and voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you find out, Jack?&rdquo; asked Desir&eacute;,
when he had released Ren&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They told me,&rdquo; he began, turning toward
her, &ldquo;that Simon lives on a street not so very
far from here. I thought if you&rsquo;re ready, we
might walk down there; and perhaps he&rsquo;d be
able to tell us where we could spend the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we going to the hotel?&rdquo; inquired
Priscilla, her face clouding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; we haven&rsquo;t enough money to stay
there,&rdquo; answered Jack, starting ahead with
Ren&eacute;.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>The little girl pouted, and shed a few quiet
tears to which Desir&eacute; wisely paid no attention.
Slowly they strolled along the main street,
pausing to look in the window of a stationer&rsquo;s
where the books and English magazines attracted
Desir&eacute;&rsquo;s eye; stopping to gaze admiringly
at the jewelry, china, pictures, and souvenirs
attractively displayed in another shop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just see the lovely purple stones!&rdquo; cried
Priscilla, who had recovered her good humor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are amethysts,&rdquo; explained Jack.
&ldquo;They come from Cape Blomidon,&rdquo; adding to
Desir&eacute;, &ldquo;I heard that another vein split open
this year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it strange that the intense cold nearly
every winter brings more of the beautiful
jewels to light?&rdquo; commented the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A kind of rough treatment which results
in profit and beauty,&rdquo; mused Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and, Jack, maybe it will be like that
with us. Things are hard now, but perhaps
soon we&rsquo;ll find&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some am&rsquo;thysts?&rdquo; asked Ren&eacute; excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; replied Jack, giving Desir&eacute; one
of his rare sweet smiles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>The stores had been left behind now, and
on every hand were green tree-shaded lawns
enclosed by carefully trimmed hedges of English
hawthorne in full bloom. Desir&eacute; exclaimed
with rapture over their beauty, and the size
and style of the houses beyond them. On a
little side street they paused before a small
cottage, half hidden in vines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This must be the place,&rdquo; decided Jack,
opening the white gate which squeaked loudly
as if protesting against the entrance of
strangers. The sound brought a woman to the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for Simon Denard,&rdquo; began
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come to the right place to find him,&rdquo;
she replied, smiling, as she came toward them
and put out one hand to pat Ren&eacute;&rsquo;s head.
&ldquo;Simon Denard is my father. I&rsquo;m Mrs. Chaisson.
Come right in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the small living room to which she led
them sat old Simon, propped up with pillows
in a big chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So here ye are,&rdquo; was his greeting, as the
children dashed across the floor to his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; warned Desir&eacute; quickly. &ldquo;You
might hurt Simon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let &rsquo;em be! Let &rsquo;em be!&rdquo; protested the
old man, beaming upon his visitors. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
an extra stab of pain, or two?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Father has told me about you people so
often that I feel as if I knew you,&rdquo; Mrs.
Chaisson was saying to Jack, after he introduced
Desir&eacute; and the children; &ldquo;so I want you
to stay here as long as you&rsquo;re in town; that
is, if you haven&rsquo;t made other plans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The expression on her kindly face indicated
clearly that she hoped they hadn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there are so many of us,&rdquo; objected
the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly all right, if you don&rsquo;t mind
kind of camping out a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we expect to do all summer,&rdquo;
said Desir&eacute;; &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll surely be glad of any
arrangements you make for us, as long as we
don&rsquo;t put you about too much. You are very
kind indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s all settled,&rdquo; said their hostess
briskly; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get supper right away; for you
must be hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cottage boasted of a living room, dining
room, kitchen, and two small bedrooms; so
stowing away four extra people was something
of an achievement. Immediately after they had
finished the simple but delicious meal that Mrs.
Chaisson prepared, Desir&eacute; shyly offered to help
her hostess in preparation for the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, my dear; if you will clear up
the supper table and do the dishes while I hunt
up some bedding, it will be very nice.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t trouble yourself about me,&rdquo;
said Jack, detaining Mrs. Chaisson on one of
her many trips through the room; &ldquo;I can sleep
on the porch, or anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix some place for you,&rdquo; she replied,
putting her hand on his shoulder. &ldquo;Just go
on with your business arrangements.&rdquo; He and
Simon had been discussing the route, customers,
stock, and other details.</p>
<p>Like so many childless women, Mrs. Chaisson
had a passion for children; and the thoughts
of this little family starting out so bravely in
search of a living moved her strongly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How I wish I could adopt them all,&rdquo; she
thought as she hurried on. &ldquo;If only we had a
little more money; but then, there&rsquo;s Father,
too, now; it couldn&rsquo;t be done, even with the
help of that fine big boy. I don&rsquo;t wonder that
his sister almost worships him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nine o&rsquo;clock saw them all settled for a good
sleep. Old Simon in his own room, Mrs.
Chaisson sharing hers with Priscilla, Desir&eacute; on
the couch in the living room, and Jack and Ren&eacute;
in hammocks on the screened porch. It had been
decided before they slept that as soon as breakfast
was over, they would start out upon the
great adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no use in hanging around here,&rdquo;
Jack had said to Desir&eacute; in their goodnight talk
on the front steps.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it seem rather odd, or ungrateful,
to hurry away so soon?&rdquo; suggested the girl.
&ldquo;Mrs. Chaisson has been so very good to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; replied Jack quickly; &ldquo;and
for that very reason, we can&rsquo;t take advantage
of her. Then too, the longer we stay, the harder
it will be for both sides when we do go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy had immediately sensed the good
woman&rsquo;s distress over their undertaking, and
felt that the kindest act would be their immediate
departure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I realize,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that it&rsquo;s
nice for you to have a little rest, and a woman&rsquo;s
companionship; but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry over me, Jack dear,&rdquo; replied
his sister, slipping her hand into his. &ldquo;Whatever
you decide is all right. So we&rsquo;ll all be
ready early in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good little soul,&rdquo; answered Jack,
with an affectionate goodnight kiss. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know what I&rsquo;d do without you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Completely happy at his words of commendation,
Desir&eacute; entered the house; and soon everyone
was fast asleep. Shortly after midnight, she
was suddenly awakened by the sound of a screen
door closing, and steps crossing the porch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><br />CHAPTER V
<br />A MIDNIGHT WALK</h2>
<p>The thought that perhaps Jack was ill immediately
flashed across Desir&eacute;&rsquo;s mind. Throwing
on a kimono, she hurried to the door. Down
the walk which led to the street, through the
gate which had been left part way open, and
along the road walked&mdash;Priscilla!</p>
<p>No mistaking, even in the shadows, that
plump childish form. Where was she going?
Without stopping to do more than catch up
the child&rsquo;s coat, and her own which hung beside
the door, Desir&eacute; followed her. Not wanting
to call lest she should waken the neighborhood,
she had to run to catch up to her sister;
for Priscilla had quickened her pace as she
approached the end of the road and turned
onto the main street. Coming abreast with her
at last, Desir&eacute; took the child&rsquo;s arm; and, stooping
to look at her face, was startled to see
that her eyes, though open, were unseeing.
Shaking with fright, Desir&eacute; asked softly&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going, Prissy?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;To the Grand Hotel,&rdquo; was the prompt and
surprising reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, darling,&rdquo; protested the older girl,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s night, and everybody is in bed and
asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to sleep there. I&rsquo;ve always
wanted to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Desir&eacute; realized in a flash that Priscilla
must be walking in her sleep. She remembered
now that Mother had once spoken of her doing
it when she was a very little girl and had become
greatly excited over something. The
splendors of the hotel must have been on her
mind as she went to sleep.</p>
<p>How to get the child back without arousing
her was a problem; she had heard that sleepwalkers
must not be wakened suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, dear,&rdquo; she said quietly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s getting
cool. Let&rsquo;s put on our coats before we go any
farther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Priscilla stopped obediently, and, after both
girls had put on their coats, Desir&eacute; took the
little girl&rsquo;s arm and turned her gently around,
beginning a low monologue as she did so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going in the wrong direction; we
must go this way. Soon we&rsquo;ll be there. Just
down this street. We must be very quiet so
no one will hear us. Step softly. Quiet!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>Leading, coaxing, hushing, Desir&eacute; finally got
her sister into the house without waking any
one, and settled her upon the living-room
couch; for she dared not trust her out of her
sight again that night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re all right,&rdquo; she whispered, removing
the child&rsquo;s coat. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that a lovely
bed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; breathed Priscilla, curling up under
the blanket.</p>
<p>Noiselessly Desir&eacute; drew a big rocking chair
close to her sister&rsquo;s side, propped her feet up
on the edge of the couch, and with the two
coats spread over her, prepared to spend the
rest of the night. No one must know of this
escapade. Mrs. Chaisson would be distressed
at not having awakened; Jack would be disturbed
at having slept so soundly, and perhaps
disapprove of her not calling him; and old
Simon would be troubled by the idea of what
might have happened. Also, Priscilla would
probably be made nervous. Too excited to
sleep, she dozed, dreamed, started, and wakened
again until the first far-away call of a robin
pierced the faint grey dawn. Immediately one
in a tree beside the cottage answered; then a
cock crowed; a song sparrow began its short
sweet strains; and the day of the great adventure
had really begun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Prissy,&rdquo; she whispered, a little later, bending
over the child.</p>
<p>The blue eyes opened lazily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get dressed, Prissy, and surprise Mrs.
Chaisson by having the table set and things
started before she wakens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed the little girl, sitting up;
&ldquo;but&mdash;but&mdash;how did I get here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were rather restless; so I brought you
out here with me&mdash;&rdquo; began Desir&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you slept in the chair! Oh, you must
be <i>so</i> tired, Dissy. Why did you do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right, dear. Never mind about it.
Don&rsquo;t say anything of it to <i>any one</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Priscilla, wondering at her
sister&rsquo;s earnestness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because Jack might be afraid I was too
tired to start out today, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, are we really going this morning?&rdquo; demanded
Priscilla, her mind immediately occupied
with the exciting prospect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and it&rsquo;s going to be a glorious day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sound of their voices roused the others;
and while breakfast was being prepared, and
the house set in order&mdash;for Desir&eacute; would not
leave their hostess any extra work&mdash;Jack got
the team and wagon ready for departure. At
nine o&rsquo;clock, after reluctant and affectionate
farewells had been exchanged, Jack gathered
up the reins. Beside him sat Desir&eacute;, and directly
back of them on little stools were Priscilla
and Ren&eacute;.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, remember,&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Chaisson,
handing a lunch basket to Desir&eacute;, &ldquo;that this
is your home whenever you are in Yarmouth,
or any other time you need one. And whenever
you can, let me hear how you&rsquo;re getting
on. We&rsquo;ll be thinking of you all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Desir&eacute;, kissing Mrs.
Chaisson affectionately, and adding for the
tenth time&mdash;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been so very good to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall never forget it,&rdquo; said Jack, tightening
the reins; and Dolly and Dapple, moving
away from the gate, put an end to the farewells.</p>
<p>No one saw, hidden away among the maple
saplings, scrub pine, and underbrush which
covered the field beside the house, the bulky
figure of a man. Neither did they hear softly
muttered words of anger and revenge.</p>
<p>After they had left Yarmouth behind and
were jogging along the road back over the same
route they had covered on the train the day
before, Desir&eacute; turned sidewise in the seat to
inspect once more the interior of their &ldquo;store.&rdquo;
At the back was their trunk, and next to it their
box; and on either side, reaching to the very
top of the wagon, shelves tightly packed with
jars, cans, rolls of material. The small tent
which they had bought on their way out of
town was laid along the floor at one side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I must get acquainted with all the stock,&rdquo;
she observed; &ldquo;so I&rsquo;ll be able quickly to find
what people want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first time we stop, you can look things
over,&rdquo; replied Jack. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d lose your balance
and be rolling out if you tried to do it while
we&rsquo;re moving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The younger ones laughed hilariously. They
were in high spirits now, and even Jack felt
a thrill of excitement under his sober, staid
manner.</p>
<p>Up and down the long hills they drove, past
numberless lakes and ponds, in and out of
woods sweet with the odor of sun-warmed pine,
and across rivers whose red mud flats made a
vivid splash of color on the landscape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So many, many little bodies of water,&rdquo;
murmured Desir&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ground is so uneven,&rdquo; explained Jack,
&ldquo;that the water settles and forms lakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are the river banks so wide, and so
very muddy?&rdquo; asked Priscilla, leaning on the
back of the seat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Out there,&rdquo; answered Jack, waving his arm
toward the West, &ldquo;is the Bay of Fundy, a big,
windy, rough body of water, an arm of the Atlantic
Ocean. This bay has huge tides, rising
in some places to a height of fifty or seventy
feet. When the tide is high, the water rushes
into all the rivers on this side of the country
and fills them to overflowing; then all these
banks are covered up. The tide comes twice a
day; so you see the flats have no time to dry
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through Brazil, Lake Annes, and Hectanooga
they had passed without stopping, and
then the children began to get hungry. Jack
drew up to the side of the road in the open
country, and stopped in the shade of a huge
oak tree. There they ate the lunch which Mrs.
Chaisson had put up for them, and rested a
while, breathing in deep breaths of clover-scented
air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;See the chipmunk, Ren&eacute;,&rdquo; said Jack, pointing
to a little animal who was regarding them
doubtfully from the trunk of a nearby tree.
&ldquo;See the stripes along his back? Well, once
upon a time, many years ago, a wonderful
being called Glooscap lived up on Cape Blomidon.
He was half god and half man, and tried
to make Nova Scotia a very happy, safe place
to live in. But there were wicked witches who
lived here also, and they wanted to do all kinds
of harm. The strongest of them was called
Gamona, and any animal who was caught by
her was killed or shut up in some cave or hole.
One day little Charlie Chipmunk disobeyed his
mother and went too far away from home.
Suddenly, while he was nibbling at a most delicious
nut, he felt himself picked up in terrible
sharp claws. What was it his mother had told
him to do if he ever got into danger? Alas!
He couldn&rsquo;t remember, and the creature, at
whose face he dared not look, was carrying
him away so, so fast! Some name he should
call. Whose name? Like the lightning which
sometimes made their hollow-tree home bright
as day, it flashed into his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Glooscap!&rsquo; he squeaked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a tiny, trembling cry reached nowhere
at all in that great big forest, yet Glooscap
heard it and came to help the little fellow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Let my child go!&rsquo; he ordered, in a voice
which, though not very loud, seemed to fill the
whole land with its power.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gamona ground her teeth with anger. She
knew she must obey, yet how she hated to let
such a nice plump chipmunk go. Slowly she
opened her hand just a little bit, then a little
bit more; but the space was not quite wide
enough for fat little Charlie. Her long sharp
claws scraped his back as he wiggled out, and
made long dark scratches. Ever since that day
the chipmunk has worn those stripes down the
middle of his back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I c&rsquo;n see &rsquo;em jes&rsquo; as plain,&rdquo; observed
Ren&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; proposed Priscilla, &ldquo;see if he&rsquo;ll
eat these crusts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t we have stopped at some of the
places we passed?&rdquo; ventured Desir&eacute;, hesitatingly.
She did not want to seem critical of
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simon had no names on his list before
Saulnierville; and I thought he probably knew
the ropes better than we.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t we take on any new customers,
then?&rdquo; Desir&eacute; asked anxiously. She was so
eager to make a huge success of this strange
business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, if we can; but the places we passed
are so close to Yarmouth that I felt the city
would get all their trade,&rdquo; replied Jack, taking
the huge red clover top that Ren&eacute; had presented
him, and sticking it in Desir&eacute;&rsquo;s black
curls. &ldquo;I hope to get to Church Point in the
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;d better get started now,&rdquo; decided
Desir&eacute;, getting up and shaking off the
grass and leaves which the children had thrown
upon her in their play.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>None of them were accustomed to constant
riding, and the afternoon seemed very long.
The novelty of the situation and the scenery
had worn off, and they were acutely conscious
of cramped muscles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I get out and walk for a while?&rdquo;
asked Priscilla, as they approached Meteghan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d thought we&rsquo;d stop up here on the main
street for a while to see if anyone wants to
buy anything,&rdquo; said Jack, in reply to Desir&eacute;&rsquo;s
questioning look; &ldquo;so if you will follow us
<i>carefully</i>, you may get out here. But be sure
to keep us in close sight, and don&rsquo;t go wandering
off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped the horses, and Priscilla scrambled
out amid clamors of Ren&eacute; to go with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Renny,&rdquo; said Desir&eacute;, &ldquo;you come and
ride in front between Jack and me. Won&rsquo;t that
be fun?&rdquo; pulling him across the back of the
seat. But he continued to fret and cry until
Jack said sternly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ren&eacute;, we&rsquo;ve had enough of that. Stop it at
once or go into the back of the wagon by yourself.
You&rsquo;re too big a boy to act like a baby.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>The child looked at his brother, and quickly
recognizing the determination and force in the
serious gaze bent upon him, set about controlling
himself. Jack evidently meant business
when he spoke in that tone. In their anxiety to
compose Ren&eacute; before they entered the town
proper, they temporarily forgot about Priscilla.
Like a flash, Desir&eacute; turned to look back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack!&rdquo; she gasped, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see Prissy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy stopped the horses at once, and for
a moment scanned the empty road in consternation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><br />CHAPTER VI
<br />THE PIE SOCIAL</h2>
<p>Turning the team, they started back.
Dapple and Dolly lagged along, heads down;
they were tired, and it was close to supper
time.</p>
<p>Jack and Desir&eacute; peered into the bushes and
trees on either side of the road for a glimpse
of a red coat. Around a bend, among the trees
far back from the road, they finally saw what
they sought. Stopping the wagon, they watched
for a moment to see what she was doing. Intently,
apparently without thought of anything
else, she was stealthily following a small black
and white animal. Before they could shout a
warning, she suddenly darted forward and
seized the little creature. Out of her hands it
twisted, filling the air with a strong, unpleasant
odor; then it disappeared into the dense woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; groaned Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Priscilla!&rdquo; called Desir&eacute; sharply.</p>
<p>The child looked up, and began coming
toward them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stand right where you are,&rdquo; directed Jack,
when she reached the edge of the clearing.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come any nearer. What on earth possessed
you to meddle with a wood pussy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I thought it was a kitten,&rdquo; faltered the
little girl, thoroughly frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;d followed us closely, as Jack told
you, you wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten into trouble,&rdquo;
said Desir&eacute; severely. &ldquo;What can we do with
her, Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get a pail of water from that pond,
while you find fresh clothing; then I&rsquo;ll carry
the things over to the woods. She&rsquo;ll have to
go behind that clump of scrub pine and take
off her clothing, make up the garments into a
bundle, throw it as far into the woods as she
can, then bathe and put on fresh things,&rdquo; replied
Jack, taking a pail and starting down the
road toward a small, but deep, pool of water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and help her,&rdquo; said Desir&eacute;, when
he returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay right where you are,&rdquo; he directed
quietly but firmly. &ldquo;She can manage perfectly
well by herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He crossed the road; and Desir&eacute;, though she
could not quite distinguish the words, listened
to the brief, curt orders he issued to the unfortunate
little girl. Then he returned and stood
leaning against the side of the wagon. Ren&eacute;
had dozed off, and Desir&eacute; laid him on the seat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is one phase of our adventure that
we did not consider,&rdquo; began Jack, after a
pause. His face looked more serious, even, than
usual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? Prissy getting mixed up with a wood
pussy?&rdquo; laughed Desir&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. The problem of discipline. The free
and lazy life is going to let the youngsters get
a bit out of hand, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ren&eacute;&rsquo;s only a baby,&rdquo; said Desir&eacute; reassuringly.
&ldquo;We should have no trouble managing
him. Of course Priscilla is rather difficult at
times; she goes from one extreme to another
so quickly. You never know exactly what she
will do next. At home, I sometimes sent her
to bed; but that would be rather difficult in a
wagon. But she&rsquo;s a good little thing, and we&rsquo;ll
do the best we can. You mustn&rsquo;t worry about
it, Jack,&rdquo; concluded Desir&eacute;, bending over to
touch his thick brown curls.</p>
<p>He caught her hand in his and held it until
Priscilla appeared from among the trees,
freshly clothed, and swinging the empty pail in
her hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>Without a word Jack helped her into the
wagon and they headed once more for the town.
The sun had sunk below the horizon; the woods
were getting dim; and the sky was a soft rose
and gold when they entered Meteghan. Surely
the whole population must be abroad, so filled
were the streets with people all headed toward
the church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose is going on?&rdquo; asked
Desir&eacute;, viewing the scene rather wistfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Jack, pulling the
wagon into a free space between two other
vehicles. Almost immediately a tall, awkward
youth sauntered over to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s old Simon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack explained, adding, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s doing
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pie social,&rdquo; was the laconic reply. &ldquo;Better
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is it held?&rdquo; asked Desir&eacute;, leaning
out and smiling down into his keen grey eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Church basement; it&rsquo;s for the benefit of
the church. Costs you a pie to get in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point, a companion called to the boy,
and he strolled away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like to go?&rdquo; asked Jack, who had not been
unobservant of Desir&eacute;&rsquo;s eager interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could we? We haven&rsquo;t any pies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be some place to buy them.
Surely some enterprising person would foresee
the market. Let&rsquo;s look around a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>He tied the horses to a post and locked the
doors. Ren&eacute; was wide awake by this time, and
eager for new adventures; so the four, Priscilla
still silent, walked along the streets of the
little town until they found a place bearing a
sign&mdash;&ldquo;Pies for sale.&rdquo; Here they purchased
four pies, and turned their steps toward the
church. At the door a pretty girl took their
donations, and they were allowed to enter.
Along the sides of the little basement were
rough board counters loaded with pies of every
size and variety. One could buy whatever one
desired, from a whole pie to a small slice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re like the Chinese,&rdquo; smiled Jack, as
they stood eating pieces of custard pie; &ldquo;dessert
first, then more substantial food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pretty girl who had been at the door
now approached them, and smiling at Jack,
said&mdash;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to dance here tonight
after all the pies are sold. Hope you will all
stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but we shall not be able to,&rdquo; he
replied courteously. &ldquo;I have old Simon&rsquo;s
wagon out there, and can&rsquo;t leave it so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we heard about the young man who was
going to take Simon&rsquo;s route. My folks know
him real well. He often puts the wagon in our
barn and stays all night at our house. Why&mdash;wait
a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She darted off, and returned almost immediately
with a short, thick-set man, who looked
like a farmer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is my father, Jean Riboux,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Prudence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Wistmore,&rdquo; replied Jack, shaking
hands; &ldquo;and these are my sisters, Desir&eacute;
and Priscilla; and my little brother Ren&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pleased to know you, both for yourselves
and for old Simon,&rdquo; responded the man, with
unmistakable cordiality. &ldquo;You must make free
at our place, same as he did. Drive over, put
up the team, and stay all night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though Jack protested, the man would hear
of no refusal, and ten minutes later they turned
into a nearby farmyard. Jean took the horses
away from Jack, and sent the Wistmores into
the house to his wife who had come to the door
to meet them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your husband and daughter insisted upon
our coming here for the night,&rdquo; said Jack, after
introductions had been made; &ldquo;but I think it is
entirely too much. There are so many of us&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s always a welcome here for any
friends of old Simon&rsquo;s,&rdquo; was Mrs. Riboux&rsquo;s
quiet reply; &ldquo;and we have plenty of room. We
were sorry to hear of his bad luck; but then,
it turned out well for you,&rdquo; looking at the little
family curiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the opportunity to take the route came
just as we were looking for something for the
summer,&rdquo; said Desir&eacute;, smiling shyly at their
hostess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, then you&rsquo;re not goin&rsquo; to keep it regular?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That can not be decided,&rdquo; contributed Jack,
&ldquo;until we see how things go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they gathered around the table for
supper, the boy who had told them about the
Pie Social slid into one of the chairs and
grinned at Desir&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d see me again so soon,
did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Ormand, Orrie for short,&rdquo; explained
Prudence, who sat beside Jack right across the
table from them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guessed who you people were as soon as
I laid eyes on Dapple and Dolly; and I knew
you&rsquo;d turn up here finally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conversation of the elders turned to
crops, and continued throughout the meal, while
the younger people talked of the coming dance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Mrs. Riboux to Desir&eacute;, as they
left the table, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you put the little
fellow to bed and go to the dance with my boy
and girl? I&rsquo;ll watch out for him,&rdquo; as Desir&eacute;
hesitated and looked at Jack. &ldquo;All ages go to
these socials, so your sister could go along
too,&rdquo; she added, as the Wistmores started up
the long flight of stairs to their rooms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put Ren&eacute; to bed while you dress up a
bit,&rdquo; offered Jack, taking the little boy by the
hand, and preparing to leave Desir&eacute;.</p>
<p>She detained him, however, and asked in a
low tone, &ldquo;What about&mdash;?&rdquo; motioning toward
the door of her room, which Priscilla had entered
ahead of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trot on into that room across the hall,
Renny,&rdquo; directed Jack, starting him in the right
direction; &ldquo;and see how nearly ready for bed
you can get before I come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although she is far too young for dances,&rdquo;
he continued, &ldquo;since it is the custom here for
girls of her age to attend them, I should have
allowed her to go; but in the light of this afternoon&rsquo;s
escapade, I think she should be deprived
of the pleasure. Don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&mdash;e&mdash;s; I suppose so; but I&rsquo;m afraid she&rsquo;ll
make a fuss, for she expects to go. And I do
hate to disappoint her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without replying, Jack stepped into the room
where his younger sister was standing before
an old-fashioned mirror combing her hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Priscilla,&rdquo; he began quietly, &ldquo;you weren&rsquo;t
counting on going to the dance; were you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; she retorted quickly, turning
to face him. &ldquo;You heard Mrs. Riboux say that
girls of my age go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is not the point at all. What about
this afternoon&rsquo;s disobedience?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t my fault that I met that awful
animal,&rdquo; she muttered, half under her breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are being purposely stupid, Priscilla.
You know very well that you were deliberately
disobedient in not following the wagon as I
told you to. If you can&rsquo;t obey, we shall all
have a miserable summer. To impress that fact
on your mind, you must stay right here in your
room until we come back; that is, unless Ren&eacute;
wants something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack crossed the hall to his own room, and
Desir&eacute; looked pityingly on her sister, who had
thrown herself into a chair beside the window
and was giving way to tears. There was no use
trying to reason with Priscilla when the child
was in one of these moods; so she went about
her own preparations for the evening, in silence;
but considerable of her own pleasure
was taken out of the prospect.</p>
<p>Before leaving, she stooped over the big chair
in which the little girl crouched, put her arms
around her, and kissed her affectionately without
speaking. Priscilla also said nothing, but
she returned the kiss; and Desir&eacute;, recognizing
the act as the beginning of a return to normal
conditions, felt happier about leaving her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>Ormand and Prudence Riboux were evidently
very popular among the young folks of the
country; and they introduced their guests to
so many boys and girls that the Wistmores
were never at a loss for partners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it <i>fun</i>!&rdquo; cried Desir&eacute; joyously, as
she said goodnight to Jack in the dim upper
hall, lighted only by their two candles. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t
you have a good time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And just think, we&rsquo;ve made some new
friends already. I like the Riboux family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I; they&rsquo;re fine people,&rdquo; agreed Jack
absentmindedly. He was thinking about tomorrow&rsquo;s
trip into the Clare District. That was
going to be the hardest part of the route, going
through their old home and its neighboring
towns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack!&rdquo; cried Desir&eacute;, as she entered her
room. &ldquo;Prissy&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><br />CHAPTER VII
<br />A FRIGHT</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; echoed Jack, staring blankly
around the room. &ldquo;Where could she possibly
go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; but you see she isn&rsquo;t here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were few places to look. Jack peered
under the big bed, while Desir&eacute; looked in the
clothes press and a deep chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; she whispered, twisting
her hands together and trying to force
back the tears. &ldquo;Is Ren&eacute; in your room?&rdquo; as a
sudden thought occurred to her.</p>
<p>With two steps, Jack crossed the hall and
stuck his head into the room opposite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; he&rsquo;s in bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Riboux, sensing that something was
wrong, came out of her room, followed by her
husband. Their exclamations brought Prudence
and Ormand to join the group. A few
minutes of excited consultation resulted in Mr.
Riboux going out to notify the authorities that
a child was missing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>While the women searched the house from
top to bottom, Jack and Ormand, aided by the
feeble rays of a lantern, looked about the barns
and yard. A group of men and boys from the
town were soon scouring the nearby woods, and
Desir&eacute;, who had returned to her room after
the fruitless trip through the various rooms,
could see the moving lights and hear occasional
shouts.</p>
<p>The forced inaction maddened her. If there
were only <i>something</i> she could do besides wait.
What danger might not Priscilla be in while
she stood helpless here?</p>
<p>After a long time Mr. Riboux, followed by
Jack and Ormand, crossed the yard, and she
ran downstairs hoping for news. Her brother
merely shook his head gravely when they met
in the kitchen where Mrs. Riboux was making
coffee and setting out a lunch for the men who
were still in the woods. One by one they
straggled in, reporting no luck at all.</p>
<p>Desir&eacute;&rsquo;s own acute distress was increased
every time she looked at Jack&rsquo;s stern, set face.
Well she knew by the deep lines between his
eyes that he was blaming himself for Priscilla&rsquo;s
disappearance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>Although it had been a great relief to have
Ren&eacute; sleep through the first excitement, now it
was a distinct pleasure to hear his voice from
upstairs and be able to run up and see what
he wanted. At least it provided something to
<i>do</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming,&rdquo; called Desir&eacute;, stopping in her
room to get a lamp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t want you,&rdquo; replied Ren&eacute; rudely, as
she entered. &ldquo;Want Prissy. She was going
to catch the mouse,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mouse,&rdquo; repeated his sister in bewilderment,
feeling his head to see if he were
feverish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the little boy, jerking fretfully
away from her and pointing to the corner behind
the bed.</p>
<p>There lay Priscilla, curled up on the floor,
fast asleep, with Polly, the big grey house cat,
clasped tightly in her arms. The animal
blinked at the light and uttered a loud
&ldquo;Me-o-w!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desir&eacute;, together with Jack who had by that
time followed her, stood speechless, looking
down at the sleeping child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to know if she caught that mouse,&rdquo;
demanded Ren&eacute; in positive tones.</p>
<p>At that moment Priscilla, aroused by the
sound of voices, opened her eyes, a bit bewildered
by the sudden awakening. She looked
blankly from one to another, her gaze finally
centering on Jack&rsquo;s face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t disobey you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Ren&eacute;
called me because he was frightened of a mouse.
You said I might leave the room if he wanted
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what are you doing down here on the
floor, darling?&rdquo; asked Desir&eacute; softly; for Jack
could not speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got Polly and sat down here by the
mouse&rsquo;s hole so&rsquo;s she could catch him when he
came out again; and we all kept so quiet I
guess we went to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack picked the little girl up, carried her
to the room across the hall, and held her close
for a moment before laying her on the bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both of you get to sleep as soon as you
can,&rdquo; he directed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go down and tell the
family she&rsquo;s found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Jack angry at me?&rdquo; inquired Priscilla,
sleepily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit, dear. We thought you were lost.
Everybody has been looking all over for you,
out in the barn, in the woods, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here I was all the time,&rdquo; giggled the
child, wholly unconscious of having been the
cause of great anxiety and effort.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>Along the shore, the next morning, as the
Wistmores started out after parting reluctantly
with the Riboux family, were hundreds of gulls
looking for food, and the air was filled with
their harsh croaking cries. Out on the blue
waters floated others, at rest on the ripples.
In the meadows herds of black and white cows
wandered about, cropping the grass heavy with
dew, their bells tinkling constantly as they
sought for choicer tidbits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before we get to Saulnierville we make our
first stop,&rdquo; said Desir&eacute;, consulting the list she
had taken from Jack&rsquo;s pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be there shortly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope we sell just lots of stuff!&rdquo; cried
Priscilla, who was quite herself again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, lots of stuff,&rdquo; echoed Ren&eacute;, grabbing
Jack around the neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t choke brother,&rdquo; laughed Desir&eacute;,
loosening the embracing arms.</p>
<p>Before many minutes passed, they came in
sight of a small grey house. An immense grey
barn stood behind it, its double doors freshly
painted a brilliant red. The farm was enclosed
by a grey fence with double gates of pure
white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t the gates and the doors match,
I wonder,&rdquo; remarked Priscilla, who had an eye
for color combinations.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the faintest idea,&rdquo; replied Jack,
bringing the wagon to a stop before a path
bordered with clam shells. The path led up to
the front door, and another row of clam shells
surrounded the house, which was built, like so
many others in Nova Scotia, with overlapped
shingles on one side and clapboards on the
other three.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the youngsters run about a bit while
I go in,&rdquo; directed Jack, preparing to climb
over the wheel.</p>
<p>At this moment the sound of galloping horses
on the road over which they had just come
made everyone turn; and they saw another
wagon, the counterpart of their own, swaying
crazily from side to side as the driver urged
on his excited animals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Runaway!&rdquo; squealed Ren&eacute; delightedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll hit us!&rdquo; shrieked Priscilla.</p>
<p>Jack deftly pushed off the road into a
field, and jumped from the wagon ready to be
of assistance. His keen eye saw at once, however,
that the approaching team was not out
of control. As soon as it came abreast of the
Wistmore &ldquo;store&rdquo; the driver pulled up with
a suddenness which threw the animals on their
haunches; and, leaping from his seat, he faced
Jack belligerently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><br />CHAPTER VIII
<br />A FIGHT</h2>
<p>&ldquo;My territory!&rdquo; growled the man, motioning
toward the house. &ldquo;What are <i>you</i> doing
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re mistaken,&rdquo; responded Jack quickly.
&ldquo;I have old Simon&rsquo;s entire route, and this is
the first stop on the list he gave me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may have been his, but it ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to
be yours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who is going to prevent me?&rdquo; inquired
Jack, in even, quiet tones which Desir&eacute; knew
meant that he was working hard to keep his
temper under control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> am. I made up my mind soon as I heard
the old man was sick, that I would take this
route; and nobody&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to stop me. Least
of all, <i>you</i>,&rdquo; he added, looking Jack&rsquo;s slender
form up and down contemptuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You great&mdash;big&mdash;&rdquo; began Priscilla excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, Prissy,&rdquo; said her brother. &ldquo;You
and the others stand over there beside the
wagon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>As he spoke, he started in the direction of
the farmhouse. Like a flash the thick-set figure
was in his pathway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he sneered.</p>
<p>The two measured each other silently for a
moment, standing as motionless as dogs in that
last tense moment just before they spring.</p>
<p>Jack put out his foot to advance, and his
opponent was upon him. They fell heavily to
the ground, the stranger on top.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll kill him!&rdquo; sobbed Priscilla, while
Ren&eacute; added his wails to hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t kill Jack!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; pleaded Desir&eacute;, her eyes wide with
fright. &ldquo;Say a prayer that Jack will come out
all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The terrified little group watched the two
adversaries roll over and over, pounding, grappling,
struggling. Then Jack, with a quick
twist, loosened the grasp of the other and
sprang to his feet. With surprising swiftness,
for a man so heavy, the enemy also righted
himself and again leaped upon Jack. Back and
forth they swayed, locked in a close embrace,
each trying desperately to keep his own footing
and trip the other. At times they stood
stock still waiting to get breath and strength
for a renewal of the contest. Then it began
all over again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>Finally Jack succeeded in twisting one of his
long legs quickly around one of his adversary&rsquo;s,
thereby throwing him heavily to the ground.
With a leap, Jack was astride of him, pinning
his arms to the earth. The man tried to roll
sufficiently to throw him off, but Jack was too
well placed to allow him very much motion.
Weight, anger, and unskilled methods had
worked against him; now Jack had complete
advantage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I give you what you deserve?&rdquo; demanded
Jack, after a moment&rsquo;s pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nough!&rdquo; muttered the man sullenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get off this route, then, and <i>stay</i> off of it;
or next time&mdash;&rdquo; threatened Jack, getting up.
&ldquo;Turn that team right around, and go back
to Yarmouth, or wherever you come from!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly, keeping one eye on Jack the while,
he obeyed. As soon as he was on the way, Desir&eacute;
and the children ran toward their brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack, aren&rsquo;t you hurt somewhere?&rdquo; demanded
Desir&eacute; anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a few bruises and scratches, thank
God!&rdquo; was the grateful response. &ldquo;I kept
wondering what you would do, poor child, if I
were smashed up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a good brushing, and &ldquo;first-aid&rdquo; treatment
of his scratches, Jack pronounced himself
as good as new.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Children,&rdquo; said Desir&eacute;, &ldquo;we begged so hard
for Jack&rsquo;s safety. We mustn&rsquo;t fail to say
&lsquo;Thank You&rsquo; for what we received. Let&rsquo;s each
say a little prayer of thanksgiving right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a moment of silence they again turned
their attention to the business in hand. Desir&eacute;
and the children stayed with the wagon, while
Jack started once more toward the house.</p>
<p>At his knock, the inner door opened, a
woman&rsquo;s head showed behind the glass of the
storm door, and then the outer door was pushed
back. Almost every dwelling, no matter how
small and unpretentious, has its storm door,
and usually these are left on all summer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking old Simon&rsquo;s route this summer,&rdquo;
began Jack, using the words he was to repeat
so many times that season; &ldquo;and I called to
see if you need anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; answered the plump little
woman in the doorway, her black eyes busily
inspecting Jack, and traveling rapidly to the
wagon, the girl, and the children on the road.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all out of thread, crackers, kerosene, and&mdash;what
else was it? Oh, yes, shoe laces. Where&rsquo;s
old Simon? I&rsquo;ve been watching out for him
for three weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sick, in Yarmouth,&rdquo; replied Jack, turning
to go to the wagon to fill her order. The woman
followed him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This your wife?&rdquo; she asked, curiously
staring at Desir&eacute;.</p>
<p>Jack flushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my sister; and that is another sister,
and my kid brother,&rdquo; he replied, talking more
rapidly than usual to hold the woman&rsquo;s attention;
for Desir&eacute;, overcome by laughter, had
walked a few steps down the road to recover
her composure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are your folks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead,&rdquo; was the brief reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s too bad! You so young, and
with three youngsters to keep. Dear! Dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desir&eacute; returned just in time to hear the last
remarks, and her face twitched so in her efforts
to control it that Jack himself had to bury his
head in the depths of the wagon while he
looked for the cracker boxes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come up to the house with me when this
young man carries my things in,&rdquo; she said to
Desir&eacute;, taking her by the arm. As if she were
indeed a child, she led her along the path to
the doorstep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Set here,&rdquo; she directed; and disappeared
into the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready?&rdquo; asked Jack, when he came out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I was told to &lsquo;set here&rsquo;; and
here I &lsquo;set,&rsquo;&rdquo; whispered Desir&eacute;.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>At that moment the woman returned with
a pasteboard box which she thrust into Desir&eacute;&rsquo;s
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a few cookies for your dinner. They
always taste good to children, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you so much. I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll enjoy
them,&rdquo; responded the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop every time you come around,&rdquo; called
the odd little woman, as they closed the gate
behind them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><br />CHAPTER IX
<br />IN CAMP</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well, our first sale wasn&rsquo;t so bad,&rdquo; observed
Desir&eacute;, as they drove away. &ldquo;But
wasn&rsquo;t she funny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you were going to disgrace us,&rdquo;
said Jack, smiling. &ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t behave any
better than that, I&rsquo;ll have to leave you beside
the road somewhere and pick you up later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;o&mdash;o!&rdquo; shrieked Ren&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; demanded Jack, turning
to look at the small boy behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t want Dissy left anywhere! Want her
with us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack&rsquo;s only fooling, darling; don&rsquo;t cry,&rdquo;
consoled Desir&eacute;, reaching back over the seat
to pet the little boy.</p>
<p>Peace and quiet having been restored, they
jogged along the sunshiny road, and soon were
abreast of St. Mary&rsquo;s Bay, where flecks of
white were dancing over the blue surface.</p>
<p>&ldquo;White caps,&rdquo; observed Desir&eacute;. &ldquo;Fundy
must be rough today.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Those are gulls,&rdquo; corrected Jack, &ldquo;at least
so the Indians used to believe. The Spirit of
the Sea was so fond of the birds that he caught
a lot one day and, with a long string, tied their
legs together. He keeps them down in his house
under the water, and at times he lets the gulls
come up to swim on the top of the water for
air and exercise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they fly away then? <i>I</i> would!&rdquo;
asserted Ren&eacute;, big-eyed with interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because the Spirit holds fast to the string,
and when he thinks they&rsquo;ve been out long
enough, he pulls them all down under the water
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Between Saulnierville and Little Brook they
made several stops and substantial sales. The
picnic dinner which good Mrs. Riboux had insisted
upon packing for them, they ate beside
a shady stream in which many little fish darted
about among the weeds. Ren&eacute; insisted upon
trying to catch some with his hands, but succeeded
only in getting his clothing so splashed
that Desir&eacute; had to stand him out in the sun to
dry before they could continue on their way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Church Point,&rdquo; cried Desir&eacute;, later
in the afternoon, pointing to the skyline ahead,
where a tall spire topped with a cross rose
proudly against the blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How happy the sailors must be when they
first catch sight of that point,&rdquo; mused Jack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Priscilla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because the spire can be seen for many
miles out at sea, and the sailors use it as a
guide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shadows were getting long, and the air
was much cooler by the time they drove into
the little town. On St. Mary&rsquo;s Bay several fishing
boats had already been anchored near the
sands, and farther out on the gilded water
others were heading for the shore. Over the
slight rise near the church they drove, and in
and out among the ox teams and lines of slow-moving
cows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; home but us,&rdquo; remarked
Ren&eacute; rather plaintively, making the tears
spring to Desir&eacute;&rsquo;s eyes, while the lines of
Jack&rsquo;s mouth became even more stern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silly!&rdquo; observed Priscilla. &ldquo;We <i>are</i> home.
Home&rsquo;s where Jack and Desir&eacute; are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desir&eacute; smiled up at Jack, and leaned back to
squeeze her little sister&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we try to make our sales before supper,
and then camp outside of town?&rdquo; asked
Jack; &ldquo;or shall we eat, and then sell afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sell first. Work before pleasure,&rdquo; Desir&eacute;
decided promptly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>At a house far beyond the church they came
to a halt, and Desir&eacute; leaned from the wagon
to call to a small boy in blue overalls, who sat
on the gate watching them&mdash;&ldquo;Tell your mother
that old Simon&rsquo;s wagon is here, please, and ask
her if she wants anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without a word the little fellow slid down
and ran into the house. Almost immediately a
tall, loose-jointed man, whose resemblance to
the child was marked, came out and crossed the
yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The missus is sick,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;but I
know what she wants. She&rsquo;s been talkin&rsquo; of
nothin&rsquo; else for days. Buttons, five yards of
calico, a pencil for the boy, and a few pounds
of sugar. Got old Simon&rsquo;s route for good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure. He&rsquo;s sick in Yarmouth now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So? That&rsquo;s too bad. Are you going on up
the Bay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Expect to,&rdquo; replied Jack, giving the man
his purchases and counting out change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you get to Digby would you tell the
lady in the knickknack store that I&rsquo;ll sell her
the pitcher?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to, if you&rsquo;ll tell me how to find her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Her store is the first one of its kind that
you&rsquo;ll pass. She catches all the tourists by a
window full of trash, and a sign &lsquo;Souvenir
Shoppe&rsquo; or something like that. She was out
here a few weeks ago looking for stuff, and
wanted that pitcher, but the wife didn&rsquo;t want
to sell it then. Since she&rsquo;s been sick, though,
she&rsquo;s more concerned about money than about
old pitchers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After several more stops, most of which resulted
in sales, Jack pulled off of the main road
into a balsam grove, just before dusk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You children scamper around and find
some dried wood for a fire,&rdquo; he directed, swinging
Ren&eacute; down, and going to unharness the
horses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you intend to build a fire in here, Jack?&rdquo;
asked Desir&eacute; doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, on the sand across the road. Take some
bacon and whatever else you need from the
stock while I feed Dapple and Dolly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time he had made several trips with
great armfuls of grass which he had pulled for
the animals, Desir&eacute; had gathered together her
supplies, and with the children&rsquo;s help made a
fire on the beach and set out their supper.
When Jack appeared, he took charge of the
frying of the bacon himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this <i>fun</i>?&rdquo; demanded Priscilla every
few minutes. &ldquo;Just like a picnic; and lots
nicer than eating in a house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lots nicer,&rdquo; echoed Ren&eacute;, adding, &ldquo;Now tell
me a story.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oliver Owl&rsquo;s mother had told him again
and again that he must not go anywhere near
the big cave where the wicked witch Gamona
lived,&rdquo; began Jack slowly; &ldquo;but Oliver was
getting so big and strong that he thought he
knew how to take care of himself. He had
never seen the old woman, of whom all the
forest folks spoke in whispers. So, early one
evening, his curiosity got the better of him; and
while his mother was making the beds&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack!&rdquo; interrupted Priscilla, patronizingly,
&ldquo;people don&rsquo;t make beds at night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The owls do,&rdquo; he replied gravely, &ldquo;because
they sleep in them all day and go out only at
night. Around the big home tree he fluttered
carelessly a while; then, suddenly, off like a
shot toward a big pile of rocks whose top he
could just see. Not a soul did he meet when
he reached them, not a sound did he hear except
the murmuring of a little breeze in the very top
of the pines. So fast had he hurried that he
was a very tired bird, and besides the aching
of his wings he felt just a little bit doubtful
about what would happen to him when he got
home. So he alighted on the very highest rock
of the big pile to rest, and decided how he
would explain his absence to his mother. Hardly
had he settled himself comfortably when a huge
claw-like hand shot up from below him and
grabbed his feet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; squealed Ren&eacute;.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>&ldquo;With a loud squawk he flapped his wings,
and, bending and twisting as well as he could,
managed to run his sharp beak into the fingers
which grasped him. In the instant which was
necessary for Gamona to get a fresh grip,
Oliver struggled free; and you may believe
that he lost no time in flying away from that
dangerous spot. Instead of going right home,
however, he went to see Glooscap, and tell him
what had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My eyes are so small, I can&rsquo;t see very
well,&rsquo; he complained, after he had told the
whole story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll fix that,&rsquo; replied Glooscap, stroking
the bird&rsquo;s eyes until they became larger and
larger and rounder and rounder. &lsquo;Now you&rsquo;ll
be able to see her wherever you are. Keep
faithful watch of her, and notify all the other
creatures at night when she is near.&rsquo; So that
is why the owl has such big eyes, and sits up in
the trees crying &lsquo;Who-o-o!&rsquo; all night long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now you must go to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Leaving Priscilla to clear up and keep an eye
on Ren&eacute;, Jack and Desir&eacute; crossed to the grove
to get things in order for the night. The tent
was small, and after several unsuccessful
attempts they succeeded in getting it up. Jack
cut some balsam boughs for a mattress, and
over them Desir&eacute; spread blankets, placing a
couple of cushions for pillows. The floor of
the nearby wagon was fixed in like manner for
the two girls. Ren&eacute; and Priscilla went to bed
as soon as their quarters were ready for them,
but Jack and Desir&eacute;, seated on a fallen log at
the edge of the grove, lingered to watch the
moon rising over the Bay and turning its
smooth surface to silver. Fireflies flashed in
the long grass at the edge of the grove, and
deeper in the woods were mysterious little
rustles and murmurs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The old settlers,&rdquo; said Jack softly,
&ldquo;thought the fireflies were evil spirits, and used
to set out pails of milk to appease them, and
thus keep themselves and their property from
all harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they were as thick then as they are tonight,&rdquo;
laughed Desir&eacute;, &ldquo;think how many pails
they must have had. You know so many things,
Jack&rdquo;; adding, a moment later, something
which had been on her mind all day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose that man will ever come
back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the one who disputed our
rights?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desir&eacute; nodded, burying her face on her
brother&rsquo;s shoulder, much as Priscilla might
have done.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly think so, dear,&rdquo; replied Jack,
stroking her curls. &ldquo;He was pretty well
subdued.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he might try to get even with you some
way,&rdquo; shuddered the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll keep a sharp lookout for him, but
otherwise go on our way and try not to worry
about mere possibilities, little sister,&rdquo; decreed
the boy firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we could only find out what the paper
means,&rdquo; she observed a little later, her eyes
on the shining waters of the Bay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What paper?&rdquo; asked Jack suddenly, roused
from serious thoughts of his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the one <i>n&ocirc;tre p&egrave;re</i> gave you; the
mysterious one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might stop in the center of each town,
read it aloud, and ask the inhabitants to interpret
it for us,&rdquo; Jack suggested. &ldquo;Or you and
I could take turns standing on top of the wagon
and shouting it as we go along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desir&eacute; laughed at his absurdities, as he intended
she should.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care. I&rsquo;m going to pretend that
we&rsquo;re going to find out what it means before
the summer is over.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pretend as much as you like, as long as you
won&rsquo;t let yourself be overcome with disappointment
if your day dream should turn out to be
only a nightmare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A crash behind them made them spring to
their feet in sudden fright, and a child&rsquo;s shrieks
rang through the woods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><br />CHAPTER X
<br />A NIGHT PROWLER</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Ren&eacute;!&rdquo; gasped Desir&eacute;, darting back
toward the tent.</p>
<p>Jack outstripped her, and when she reached
the scene, he was just pulling his small brother
out from under a pile of canvas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not hurt,&rdquo; he breathed with relief; &ldquo;only
badly frightened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put Ren&eacute; in Desir&eacute;&rsquo;s lap, and went to
examine the wreckage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One stake pulled right out,&rdquo; he reported.
&ldquo;Wonder how that happened. I know I had it
in tight, and there is practically no wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could he have done it in any way?&rdquo; asked
Desir&eacute;, motioning to the little boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ren&eacute;,&rdquo; said Jack, stooping before the child,
who was now quiet again, &ldquo;did you do anything
to the rope of the tent to make it fall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ren&eacute; glanced up into his brother&rsquo;s face upon
which shone the rays of the full moon, and,
turning, burrowed deep into Desir&eacute;&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guilty, I guess. Tell me exactly what you
did,&rdquo; directed Jack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Woke up. Played I was a gull; rope was my
string. Hung on it; old thing came down.
Bang!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ren&eacute;,&rdquo; said Jack, taking the child&rsquo;s face
between his hands, and forcing him to meet his
eyes, &ldquo;you must <i>never, never</i> pull on the ropes
of a tent, or meddle with any part of it. If you
do, you can&rsquo;t sleep in it with me, but will have
to stay in the wagon with the girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He picked him up and set him on a nearby
stump.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now sit right here and think about what I
have just said, while Desir&eacute; and I put the tent
up again. Don&rsquo;t move from the place, and
watch how much extra work you have made for
us when we are all so tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the tent was once more in place, Jack
returned to Ren&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, are you going to sleep in the tent or
in the wagon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the tent. I won&rsquo;t touch no ropes, nor
nothin&rsquo; again, Jack,&rdquo; promised the child, holding
up his arms. &ldquo;An&rsquo; I&rsquo;m sorry &rsquo;bout making
you and Dissy work when you&rsquo;re all tired, &rsquo;n&rsquo;
everything&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good boy,&rdquo; replied his brother,
carrying him off to bed for a second time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Goodnight, Desir&eacute;,&rdquo; he said, returning to
kiss her after Ren&eacute; was disposed of. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re
timid, call me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but, Jack dear, <i>please</i> don&rsquo;t lie awake
to take care of us. We&rsquo;ll be safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon the grove was quiet. The moon rose
higher and higher, and throughout the night
kept benevolent watch over the four children
sleeping heavily among the protective trunks
of the old balsam trees. Little creatures of the
night moved noiselessly over the dried needles
on the forest floor so as not to waken the
strangers within their midst; and a gentle
breeze stole quietly in from the Bay to waft its
pungent coolness over the tired travelers.</p>
<p>A couple of hours passed, the moon had left
the woods partly in shadow. A dark figure was
stealing carefully among the tree trunks, stopping
every few minutes to listen.</p>
<p class="tb">Beyond a band of moonlight stood the little
tent from which could be heard Jack&rsquo;s loud
breathing. Nearby was the wagon where all
was silent, and from a dark spot beyond it the
horses stamped restlessly. Skirting the habitations
of the human beings, the figure made its
way silently toward the animals. Then Dapple&rsquo;s
loud whinny sounded through the quiet wood,
answered immediately by that of his mate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Get away from our horses!&rdquo; shrilled Priscilla&rsquo;s
voice from the back of the wagon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; shouted Jack, roused
at once by the child&rsquo;s cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prissy!&rdquo; cried Desir&eacute;; &ldquo;you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s bothering Dolly and Dapple,
Jack!&rdquo; called Priscilla.</p>
<p>By that time Jack had lighted a couple of
lanterns, and he and Desir&eacute; were out in the
open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay here and hold one of these,&rdquo; he directed,
&ldquo;while I see what is wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The horses were straining at their tethers
when he reached them, but quieted at once
under familiar hands. Following an impulse,
Jack presently led them out of the woods and
into the little clearing where the wagon and
tent were placed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will they disturb you if I fasten them to
this tree?&rdquo; he asked Desir&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you find anyone?&rdquo; demanded Priscilla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a single person. I looked all around
before I brought the horses out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had a bad dream, dear,&rdquo; began Desir&eacute;,
&ldquo;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t. I heard Dapple and Dolly
holler just as plain, and they never do that
unless somebody goes near &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>Desir&eacute; looked questioningly at her brother,
but he was busy tying the animals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said firmly, when he had finished
his task, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll all go back to bed and right to
sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned briskly into the tent where Ren&eacute;
still slept peacefully, and quietness once more
descended upon the forest. Jack, however,
looped up the flap of the tent and lay watching
over his little family until the soft grey light
of the early morning began to filter through
the trees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><br />CHAPTER XI
<br />THE BLUE-COVERED BOOK</h2>
<p>Several days later, one beautiful sunny
morning, Dapple and Dolly were trotting
briskly along the Shore Road toward Digby.
For more than two miles this road winds along
the shore of Digby Basin, formed by the Bay
of Fundy waters flowing through a mile wide
break in the North Mountain Range.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Jack, pointing to the opening
between the mountains, &ldquo;is Digby Gap, or, as
the natives call it, &lsquo;Digby Gut.&rsquo; In olden days
all the fishing boats used to stop there on their
way home long enough for the fishermen to
clean their fish, and throw all the &lsquo;guts&rsquo; or insides
into the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a horrid name!&rdquo; was Priscilla&rsquo;s
comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lovely here, though,&rdquo; observed Desir&eacute;,
gazing across the sparkling water to the hazy
blue sides of the two big mountains opposite,
and back again to the forested slopes beside
the wagon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We must look out for the little shop the
man told us about,&rdquo; remarked Priscilla, to
whom the scenery meant very little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you watch for it, Prissy,&rdquo; directed
Jack. Then, turning to Desir&eacute;, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t we get
a royal welcome in Sissiboo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; in spite of their disapproval, our old
friends were wonderful to us; between the sales
we made, and their generous donations, we certainly
fared well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack, there&rsquo;s a bus!&rdquo; cried Desir&eacute; delightedly
a few minutes later. A big blue
monster bore down upon them, and they had a
glimpse of well-dressed people through its
windows; then it was gone in a cloud of dust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be coming from the hotel,&rdquo; commented
her brother. &ldquo;I understand there&rsquo;s a
big one up here somewhere above the town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to ride in one of those,&rdquo; said
Priscilla, gazing longingly down the road after
the now distant bus. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you, Desir&eacute;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I should. Perhaps some time we&rsquo;ll be
able to, but not now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They drove into the little town, and soon
spied the shop of which they were in search.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go in and give the lady the message,
Desir&eacute;,&rdquo; said Jack, pulling up the team.</p>
<p>Desir&eacute; was inclined to be rather too retiring
with strangers, and her brother thought she
should begin to overcome her diffidence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack,&rdquo; she cried, running out again a
couple of minutes later, after delivering her
message. &ldquo;Who do you suppose keeps the shop?
The lady who helped me find Ren&eacute; on the
steamer! It&rsquo;s the most interesting place. Do
come in and see it. She says we can look
around as much as we wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going on for some more stock&mdash;we&rsquo;re
all out of crackers and a few other things&mdash;but
you stay, if you wish; I&rsquo;ll come back for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you need me?&rdquo; she asked doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; so look at as many things as you can
before I get back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desir&eacute;, with a happy &ldquo;Thanks a lot,&rdquo; ran
back into the quaint little shop, while Jack
drove on, thinking how sweet she was and how
little time she had for herself or her own
interests.</p>
<p>The morning was not a busy one at the shop;
so the proprietress, a well-groomed New England
woman, was free to devote her time to
Desir&eacute;, to whom she had taken a fancy. Pleased
to see that the girl was more interested in the
pictures and books than in the foolish toys
made to attract tourist trade, she took pains to
call her attention to the best that the little store
possessed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is an interesting little account of the
early history of this country and some of its
settlers,&rdquo; said Miss Robin, who was a teacher
of history in one of the Boston schools, and
whose mind naturally centered on her subject.</p>
<p>Desir&eacute; took the small blue-bound book in her
hands and carefully turned its pages, reading
bits here and there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she suddenly exclaimed aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; inquired Miss Robin, looking
up from a pile of picture postcards she was
putting in order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The story of our own ancestors is told
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Robin came to look over her shoulder
and read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In the year 1744 when the question of
Acadian loyalty to England resulted in the
Expulsion, Jean Godet with Marie, his
wife, and Desir&eacute;, his little daughter, were
driven as exiles from Wolfville to the
States. They settled near Boston, and
some years later Desir&eacute; married one John
Wistmore, a descendant of John Alden and
Priscilla Mullins. When the Revolutionary
War broke out, being loyal Royalists, they
returned to Nova Scotia and took up farming
in Wilmot, later removing to Sissiboo.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard my father tell that same story
so many, many times,&rdquo; said Desir&eacute;, looking up
at Miss Robin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They were really your ancestors, then?&rdquo;
asked that lady. &ldquo;How very interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this last part he never told us,&rdquo; continued
the girl, indicating the closing words of
the article.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The ruins of the old Godet house near
Wolfville may still be seen; for the site
was never occupied for any length of time
after the family was deported.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You must look it up if you ever go to Wolfville,&rdquo;
said Miss Robin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, indeed. We expect to get up there
some time before winter comes, and I&rsquo;ll surely
hunt for the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep the little book,&rdquo; urged Miss Robin,
when Desir&eacute;, catching sight of Jack, laid the
volume on the counter; &ldquo;and if you come back
before I go home, stop and tell me what success
you had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; began Desir&eacute;, then stopped
abruptly&mdash;she&rsquo;d keep <i>that</i> to herself; so she
merely thanked Miss Robin warmly, and ran
out to the wagon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought we&rsquo;d have dinner at one of the
little restaurants here,&rdquo; said Jack, after she had
displayed her treasure, &ldquo;and then push on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>From the counter of the lunchroom which
they selected, they could see the long government
pier with the lighthouse at the end; and
beside it was moored one of the steamers
which cross the Bay of Fundy to St. John,
New Brunswick. Ren&eacute; was greatly disappointed
because they were not going aboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The child&rsquo;s passion for boats is rivaled
only by his passion for Indians,&rdquo; observed
Desir&eacute;, as they left the lunchroom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll see plenty of the latter at Bear
River.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desir&eacute; looked questioningly at her brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;if we get there in
time for the Cherry Festival, day after tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack, can we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to try hard to make it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clouds had been slowly gathering since noon,
and about five o&rsquo;clock great drops of rain hit
the dusty road with little &ldquo;plops.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big drops; won&rsquo;t last long,&rdquo; prophesied
Desir&eacute;; but Jack let down the curtains at the
side of the seat, and drew out a rubber blanket
to spread over their laps. Before they had
covered two miles, the rain was coming down in
earnest, and Jack turned off the road into the
pine woods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if we can keep dry here,&rdquo; he said,
half to himself. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t possibly get to the next
town tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have supper right away before the
rain begins to come through the trees,&rdquo; decided
Desir&eacute;, jumping out.</p>
<p>The pine-covered ground was still dry, and it
was very cosy under the thick boughs of the tall
trees. The persistent patter of the rain and the
murmuring of a brisk little breeze in the tree
tops added to their sense of comfort and
security.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it doesn&rsquo;t rain any harder than this, we
should be able to manage pretty well,&rdquo; said
Desir&eacute; encouragingly, as Jack peered anxiously
skyward every little while.</p>
<p>Conversation turned upon the book Miss
Robin had given Desir&eacute;, and then drifted to
Nova Scotian history.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully stupid; but it seems to me such
a hopeless jumble,&rdquo; sighed Desir&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I can straighten it out for you by
taking bare facts, and not going into detail at
all,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Just think of it this way,&rdquo; he
went on. &ldquo;About the year 1000 a man called
Leif the Lucky came here from Iceland, found
the country in the possession of the Micmac
Indians, and left it to them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>&ldquo;John Cabot touched here in 1497, and
claimed the land for England. In 1606 Samuel
de Champlain and some other Frenchman
settled at Annapolis Royal, which they called
Port Royal. A few years later the English
destroyed it, and some of the inhabitants fled
to the shores of the Basin of Minas and built
the village of Grand Pr&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, where Evangeline lived!&rdquo; interrupted
Priscilla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and where they all lived until 1747,
that is, the French who were driven out of Port
Royal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what made the English drive those
people away from their homes?&rdquo; inquired
Priscilla. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean from Port Royal, but
from Grand Pr&eacute;, like Longfellow tells about in
<i>Evangeline</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They thought the French people were not
loyal to the British government; for the country
then belonged to England. To go back to
our story, in 1629 the King of Scotland gave
the entire country to a friend of his, and the
name was changed from Acadia to Nova
Scotia, which means New Scotland. From that
time until 1710 the land was claimed by both
France and England, and was in possession of
first one and then the other. Finally Great Britain
secured it for good. Is it any clearer now?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, lots; you make everything so plain,
I wish I knew as much as you do,&rdquo; sighed
Desir&eacute; admiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope some day you will know lots more,&rdquo;
smiled Jack, adding, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;re in for
a wetting. I have felt several splashes of rain.
The trees are getting so heavy with water that
it will shower down upon us before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you simply can&rsquo;t sleep in the tent,&rdquo;
said Desir&eacute; decidedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing else for it; there&rsquo;s no room in the
wagon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me think a minute,&rdquo; said Desir&eacute;. &ldquo;I
have it! We&rsquo;ll push the trunk and box side by
side and put Ren&eacute; on them, at our feet; and
you can sleep on the wagon seat. You&rsquo;ll have
to double up, but it will be better than getting
so damp in the tent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t count on a pour like this while
we were on the road,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Too bad we
were not near enough to a town to get
lodgings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we could hardly afford that; and besides,
this is going to be lots of fun. Priscilla,
you and Ren&eacute; run up and down in that dry path
over there while we fix things,&rdquo; directed Desir&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boughs will be too wet to use for beds,&rdquo;
said Jack, moving the trunk close to the box at
the very back of the wagon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just spread the blankets on the floor,
then,&rdquo; declared Desir&eacute;, briskly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll be wretchedly uncomfortable,&rdquo;
objected her brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t hurt us a bit once in a while. I&rsquo;ll
hang this rubber blanket in front of the seat,
and a sheet back of it; and with the side curtains
down, and a blanket to spread over you,
you&rsquo;ll be fairly well off, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she asked,
working rapidly as she talked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be fine. Don&rsquo;t bother about me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When everything was ready, they called the
two children and settled down for the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened if you hear a noise once
in a while,&rdquo; said Jack, as they settled down;
&ldquo;for I shall have to turn around occasionally
to stretch my legs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, poor boy; they are far too long for
your bed tonight. I hope Renny won&rsquo;t roll off
the trunk; but if he does, he&rsquo;ll fall on top of
us and won&rsquo;t be hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s go&mdash;to&mdash;sleep&mdash;&rdquo; yawned Priscilla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An excellent idea,&rdquo; agreed Jack; and the
little family lay quietly listening to the drip of
the rain until they fell asleep.</p>
<p>All night long Desir&eacute; dreamed of papering
the old Godet house, inside and out, with mysterious
figures and letters, which fell off as fast
as she pasted them onto it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>The sun was shining brightly as they drove
down the hillside at Bear River the second
morning after, and into the ravine where dyked
lands border the river. Hundreds of cherry
trees loaded with brilliant fruit were on every
side, and on the water was clustered the craft
of those who were to take part in the sports
later in the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What funny river banks,&rdquo; commented
Priscilla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ground is below the level of the river,&rdquo;
explained Jack; &ldquo;and the banks have to be
built up of interlaced tree trunks filled in with
clay to keep the water from running over the
land. They are called dykes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indians!&rdquo; cried Ren&eacute;, full of excitement,
pointing to a group nearby.</p>
<p>Already great numbers of them had come
from a neighboring reservation for the games.
Under the heavily loaded trees, people from far
and wide wandered about, tasting first one
variety of fruit and then another. Groups of
tourists watched from the roadside, or took
part in the feasting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>Jack found a safe place for the wagon, and,
after locking it, took his little family to obtain
their share of the cherries which are free to all
on that particular day in mid-July each year.
Shortly before noon, they carried their lunch
to a shady slope from which they had a good
view of the place where the sports were to be
held. By two o&rsquo;clock, the fun was in full swing.
All kinds of races, on both land and water;
throwing contests; log rolling tests; and games
of skill or endurance. Anyone could take part,
and Desir&eacute; urged Jack to enter some of them;
but he preferred to remain a spectator. He
loved all kinds of sports, and was perfectly
fearless; but the chance of possible injury now,
when he was the head of the family, kept him
from taking part. The Indians were the most
clever participants, and frequently won, much
to Ren&eacute;&rsquo;s delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The youngster sure likes the Indians,&rdquo; observed
a man who sat next to Jack. &ldquo;Used to
be scared of &rsquo;em when I was a kid. You ought
to take him to the St. Anne&rsquo;s celebration some
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; inquired Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every year the Indians make a pilgrimage
to the Island of the Holy Family, round the
21st of July, and live up there in birch bark
tepees until after the feast, on the 26th.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do they do?&rdquo; asked Desir&eacute;, leaning
forward to look at the narrator.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, every morning they go to Mass and
attend to all their religious duties, and very
often there are weddings and First Communions.
If there&rsquo;s been any quarreling or
disputing during the year, the differences are
patched up. Then in the evenings they dance
and play games.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of games?&rdquo; asked Ren&eacute;, who was
eagerly listening to every word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, whinny, hatchet throwing, deer foot,
wheel and stick, hunt the button&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can play that,&rdquo; interrupted Ren&eacute;,
with just satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sight worth going a distance to see,&rdquo;
concluded the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I imagine so,&rdquo; replied Jack; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m
afraid we won&rsquo;t get there this year. I have old
Simon&rsquo;s traveling store this summer, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have? Then you want to open it up
when these games are over; for a crowd like
this is almost always in need of some kind of
supplies. Anyway, they&rsquo;re sure to buy something,
whether they need it or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack acted on the suggestion, and made so
many sales that when the people finally drifted
homeward it was too late to go on that night.
They put up in a woods just outside of the
town, and after supper Desir&eacute; made a discovery
that did not altogether please her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you know that some Indians are
camped a little farther down the road?&rdquo; she
asked Jack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. They may be on their way to the festival
of St. Anne&rsquo;s that the man spoke of this
afternoon. I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re quite harmless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I want to see them!&rdquo; exclaimed Ren&eacute;,
starting up.</p>
<p>With a quick move, Jack caught the end of
the child&rsquo;s blouse and prevented his departure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen plenty of Indians today to last
you for one while, young man. Besides, it&rsquo;s
your bedtime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; wailed Ren&eacute;, twisting in his
brother&rsquo;s grasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s tired,&rdquo; murmured Desir&eacute; sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t act like this, even if he is,&rdquo; said Jack
firmly. &ldquo;Ren&eacute;, behave yourself or you&rsquo;ll have
to be punished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tantrum showed no signs of abating; so
Jack promptly picked him up and started for a
nearby stream, much to his sister&rsquo;s distress;
though she never dreamed of interfering when
Jack decided that disciplinary measures were
necessary.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the brook, Jack held the boy
securely and ducked him a couple of times.
Since the purpose of the procedure was punishment,
it was rather disconcerting to have the
child&rsquo;s tantrum cries change suddenly into
squeals of delight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack,&rdquo; he sputtered, &ldquo;do it again. I
<i>love</i> the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even the serious Jack, in spite of his stern
resolves, was quite overcome by the humor of
the situation; so he decided to say no more
about punishment. However, when he got back
to the wagon, he rubbed the little fellow down
and put him to bed, refusing Desir&eacute;&rsquo;s assistance.
He and Desir&eacute; enjoyed a good laugh
over the incident when the younger children
were safe in bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this time tomorrow night, I hope we&rsquo;ll
be in Annapolis Royal,&rdquo; he said, shortly after;
&ldquo;and being a longish drive, I guess we&rsquo;d better
go to bed now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That interesting old town was not to see them
on the morrow, however.</p>
<p>Jack was the first to waken on the following
morning, much later than usual, and was surprised
to find his tent mate gone. Peering out
toward the wagon, he saw Desir&eacute; getting out of
the back of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dissy,&rdquo; he called, using Ren&eacute;&rsquo;s name for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes? I was just going to waken you. I&rsquo;m
awfully sorry, but we overslept this morning&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen Ren&eacute;?&rdquo; he interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! Isn&rsquo;t he with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desir&eacute; stood still, letting the pan which she
had in her hand fall to the ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><br />CHAPTER XII
<br />A SEARCH FOR REN&Eacute;</h2>
<p>&ldquo;He was gone when I woke up,&rdquo; called Jack,
who had been dressing rapidly. He came out of
the tent and began looking about the wagon,
tent, and surrounding woods in the persistent
fashion of people, who, under like circumstances,
feel that although search is useless,
action of some kind is an immediate necessity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ever shall we do?&rdquo; whispered Desir&eacute;,
tears streaming down her cheeks, when Jack
returned from a fruitless search of the nearby
places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get excited, dear,&rdquo; he said, putting
his arm around her shoulders. &ldquo;He could have
come to no harm, and I&rsquo;ll find him all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you must have help. Oh, I wish we
were near the Riboux family!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll drive back into the town to make
inquiry, and then see what can be done. I
know he&rsquo;s not around here; for I&rsquo;ve searched
everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;the brook?&rdquo; faltered Desir&eacute;.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I rather thought I might find him playing
there. He enjoyed it so much last night,&rdquo;
he added, with a feeble effort at a smile, &ldquo;but
there&rsquo;s no sign of him. Anyway, the water&rsquo;s
not deep enough to drown a dog, much less a
hearty youngster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack&mdash;the Indians&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Desir&eacute;, don&rsquo;t let your imagination run
away with you. They&rsquo;re perfectly harmless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I mean is, could Renny be with
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The camp&rsquo;s gone. They must have pulled
out at daybreak&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but he may have followed them,&rdquo; persisted
Desir&eacute;. &ldquo;You know how wild he was to
go over there last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a possibility,&rdquo; replied Jack, thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Probably you&rsquo;re right. If so, he is perfectly
safe; and I&rsquo;ll find out in town how to
reach them. We&rsquo;d better eat, and then drive
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They roused Priscilla, who began to cry as
soon as she heard of her brother&rsquo;s disappearance,
and continued until Jack said
gravely&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make matters worse, Prissy; you can
help by being cheerful. Never cry until you&rsquo;re
<i>sure</i> there is something to cry about. It&rsquo;s a
waste of good energy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now for town,&rdquo; he continued, as they at last
climbed into the wagon which seemed strangely
empty without the little boy. Jack was assuming
a forced cheeriness, which he was far from
feeling; for in spite of his advice to Desir&eacute;,
he was consumed with anxiety. He felt relieved,
now, at the outcome of the &ldquo;punishment&rdquo;
last night; if Ren&eacute; <i>had</i> minded, they
might think he had run away. But perhaps he
had been wrong in adopting this kind of a life,
with the children. If anything happened to
them!</p>
<p>He was interrupted by hearing Desir&eacute; say&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prissy, you sit in the back of the wagon and
keep watch on the road to see if you can discover
any traces of Ren&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, dear,&rdquo; she went on softly, as they
drove into Bear River again, &ldquo;please don&rsquo;t
blame yourself for what has happened. It
surely wasn&rsquo;t your fault, or anybody&rsquo;s for that
matter. He might have wandered off, even if
we&rsquo;d been at home; and I feel sure he is safe
with the Indians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a comfort, Dissy,&rdquo; replied her
brother, managing a half smile.</p>
<p>In front of the post office stood the very man
who had given them the information concerning
the Indians&rsquo; pilgrimage, on the preceding
day; and, pulling up, Jack told him in a few
words what had happened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s too bad,&rdquo; replied the man with
genuine concern, resting one foot on the wheel
hub; &ldquo;if I was you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it far to the Island of the Holy Family?&rdquo;
interrupted Desir&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; and come to think on&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t
suppose that band was goin&rsquo; there anyhow;
they&rsquo;d not get there in time. They&rsquo;re probably
on their way back to the reservation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then where could we look for them?&rdquo; questioned
Jack, his heart sinking at the destruction
of their hopes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I was you, I&rsquo;d keep right along this road
toward Annapolis Royal, and perhaps you&rsquo;ll
catch up with them. They don&rsquo;t travel fast, and
you could ask in every town if they&rsquo;d been
through. There&rsquo;s no real cause for you to
worry, friends, for the little chap will be
well treated. The Indians like little folks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack looked at Desir&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good advice, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he replied doubtfully, turning
the team around, and thanking the man for his
help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck to you,&rdquo; he called, as they started
off; and Priscilla, leaning out of the back of
the wagon, waved a goodbye.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>All day long they drove, almost in silence,
stopping only for a hurried lunch. Toward
evening, when the hills had turned to red
purple, they drove across a quaint covered
bridge&mdash;that is, one which has a roof and solid
sides of wood, like a house&mdash;over a stream
whose sparkling, merry water was as yellow as
gold from the reflection of the setting sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully hungry,&rdquo; sighed Priscilla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just going to propose that we stop
under these oaks for supper,&rdquo; said Desir&eacute;.
&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t live without eating.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><br />CHAPTER XIII
<br />INDIANS AND STRAWBERRIES</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Should you mind driving all night?&rdquo;
asked Jack, as they prepared to start on after
the meal and a short rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit, if you will take turns driving,&rdquo;
replied Desir&eacute; promptly. &ldquo;Priscilla can stretch
out on the blankets, and you and I alternate at
the reins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Indians have such a start on us,&rdquo; went
on Jack. &ldquo;You see in the first place they left
earlier; and then we lost all the time of our
search, and going to Bear River and back; and
it&rsquo;s important to catch up as soon as possible,
lest they should leave the road somewhere and
take a crosscut to the reservation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; assented Desir&eacute;.</p>
<p>Darkness fell; the stars came out; and the
full moon gave them light enough to follow the
winding road. Several times during the night
Desir&eacute; persuaded Jack to let her guide Dolly
and Dapple while he rested and dozed in the
corner of the seat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>On past dark farmhouses whose occupants
were sound asleep; past somber, solemn woods,
so beautiful in the daylight, but so dense,
mysterious, almost terrifying at night; across
murmuring black streams; up long hills which
made the tired horses breathe heavily, and
down the other side where one had to hold a
tight rein to keep the faithful animals from
stumbling. Occasionally a bat swooped low
enough to make Desir&eacute; duck her head with
fright, and once, while Jack was napping, she
caught sight of a huge dark bulk near the edge
of a woods; but it disappeared before the
snorting horses could be urged onward.</p>
<p>At last the moonlight darkness faded to grey;
then to a lighter grey; the sky was slashed
with faint rose, growing rapidly deeper and
mingling with gold streaks, until the sun
climbed up to survey the land; and another day
had come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Jack!&rdquo; cried Desir&eacute;, elbowing her
sleeping brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; he asked, yawning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that hollow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were on the crest of a hill, from which
they could look down into a nearby valley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tents!&rdquo; exclaimed the boy, now fully
aroused.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Indians!&rdquo; shouted Priscilla, who, wakened
by their voices, had crept up to look over their
shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prissy! How you scared me!&rdquo; cried her
sister, jumping violently.</p>
<p>Jack took the reins, and, as fast as the team
could travel, headed for the encampment. They
reached their objective just as the Indians were
beginning to break camp. Everything was in
confusion; braves striding here and there;
squaws shouldering the big bundles; children
crying; dogs barking. Running back and
forth from one group to another, they spied
Ren&eacute;.</p>
<p>Throwing the reins to Desir&eacute;, Jack jumped
down and approached an Indian who seemed to
be directing affairs. With some difficulty, he
made the red man understand his story. Partly
by signs, partly by broken English, the chief replied
that &ldquo;two suns ago they had found
strange white child among them. Where belong,
they not know. Going on to reservation. Then
send back young brave who know English to
find boy&rsquo;s people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment, Ren&eacute; caught sight of his
brother, ran across the grass, and threw himself
into Jack&rsquo;s arms, crying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found Indians, Jack! I found Indians!
Ain&rsquo;t they <i>fine</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I see you did, and they are fine,&rdquo; replied
the boy gravely, handing him over to
Desir&eacute;, who had left the team and hurried
toward them. &ldquo;Put him in the wagon, and
bring me all the candy we have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a moment the girl was back again with
several jars of candy. Jack distributed the
gaily colored sticks to all the little Indian children,
and tried to make the chief understand
his gratitude for the care taken of Ren&eacute;.</p>
<p>The tribe then struck out through the woods,
away from the main road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How lucky that we caught up to them right
here,&rdquo; said Desir&eacute;, watching them, while Ren&eacute;
waved his hand and shouted goodbyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bad, bad boy,&rdquo; declared Priscilla,
&ldquo;to run away like that and frighten us all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ren&eacute; gave her a look which was a compound
of disgust and astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were nice to me, and I had a good
time. I bet you wish you&rsquo;d been along. When
<i>you</i> ran away, you didn&rsquo;t go with nice Indians,
but a smelly old cat who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, children,&rdquo; interrupted Jack,
as he started the horses and they drove up a
slight elevation to a juniper grove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stay here for a while to let the team
rest, and incidentally get some ourselves,&rdquo; he
decreed, turning in the shade.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>While he made Dolly and Dapple comfortable,
Desir&eacute; had been trying to make Ren&eacute;
understand how much trouble he had caused.
&ldquo;You were very naughty,&rdquo; she was saying, as
Jack joined them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed the older boy, &ldquo;and he&rsquo;ll have
to be punished to make him remember it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s tone made Desir&eacute; give him an entreating
look; but he pretended not to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me, Ren&eacute;,&rdquo; he said quietly,
breaking a small switch from a nearby tree,
and leading the child farther into the grove.</p>
<p>A short silence, then a little boy&rsquo;s cries could
be heard; another silence, during which Desir&eacute;
worked madly at anything she could think of
to keep her mind off of what was going on
within the woods. Although she recognized the
need of drastic punishment in this instance, yet
she hated to have the baby hurt. After what
seemed like hours, really not more than five or
ten minutes, the brothers emerged from among
the trees, hand in hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m never, <i>never</i> going to run away again,
Dissy,&rdquo; promised the little boy, grasping her
around the neck as she stooped to put her arms
around him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Angry?&rdquo; asked Jack softly, as the child
released himself and ran off to join Priscilla
who was playing quietly with a turtle she had
discovered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; replied Desir&eacute; quickly.
&ldquo;How could you think such a thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hated to do it, especially since I knew it
hurt you so much; but he really needed a lesson.
We couldn&rsquo;t risk that sort of thing happening
again; it might not turn out so pleasantly another
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you do your best for all of us, dear,&rdquo;
she said, laying her head against his arm for a
moment; &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t worry so much about
what we may or may not think about what you
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On blankets laid on the ground, Jack and
Desir&eacute; slept much of the afternoon, while the
children played all kinds of games with the
turtle.</p>
<p class="tb">All the morning the young Wistmores had
been driving along roads bordered on either
side by hundreds of apple trees. In the valley
between the North Mountain on the Bay of
Fundy side, and the South Mountain, there are
seventy-five miles of orchards where are grown
some of the choicest varieties of apples, many
barrels of which are shipped to the United
States every year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the most celebrated apple district
in the world,&rdquo; commented Jack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How gorgeous the trees must look when
they are covered with blossoms,&rdquo; Desir&eacute; remarked.
&ldquo;I think apple trees in bloom are
among the most beautiful things in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole section is famous,&rdquo; continued
Jack. &ldquo;The first ships built on the American
continent were launched down here on the
Annapolis River; and on Allen&rsquo;s Creek, which
flows along one side of the fort, the first mill
was put up. That was in the days of
Champlain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They reached Annapolis Royal by this time,
and Jack drove up the hills to see the remains
of the fort, and point out the items of interest
to the members of his family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Champlain sailed up the Bay of Fundy,&rdquo;
he said, motioning toward that body of water,
&ldquo;and when he saw the little inlet down there,
entered by means of it, into that broad calm
body of water called Annapolis Basin. The
tree-covered sides of the hills which you see
sloping gently to the water&rsquo;s edge were dotted
with lively waterfalls, and he thought it a fine
place for a settlement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In those days,&rdquo; he continued, turning
toward Ren&eacute;, &ldquo;Great Beaver, who was an
enemy of Glooscap, lived in Annapolis Basin
with his best friend, a wolf. Now the wolf liked
to sail, and Great Beaver made a big raft for
him so he could go back and forth across the
water. One day Mr. Wolf was lying on the top
of North Mountain, resting after his sail, and
he saw the Bay of Fundy. Right down to the
Great Beaver he rushed, and asked him to dig
a canal between the two bodies of water in
order that he might have more room for his
raft. Great Beaver didn&rsquo;t like salt water; so
he refused to spoil his own home by letting in
the tide from Fundy. Clever Mr. Wolf, who
knew that Glooscap and the Beaver were not
good friends, went secretly to Glooscap and
asked him to join the two pieces of water.
Glooscap sent the lightning to split open the
North Mountain, and through the narrow opening
Mr. Wolf sailed gaily back and forth between
the Bay of Fundy and Annapolis Basin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what became of the poor Beaver?&rdquo;
asked Priscilla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he had to go and build a new home in
the Basin of Minas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Beaver,&rdquo; commented Ren&eacute;, adding,
&ldquo;Jack, where is Glooscap <i>now</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He became angry at the number of white
men coming to take possession of the land; so
he called a big whale to carry him away to some
far-off shore. The Indians think, though, that
some day he will come back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wish he would,&rdquo; cried the little boy;
&ldquo;I wish he would right <i>now</i>, so&rsquo;s I could see
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Going down the hill, they reached the shores
of the Basin in time to see the tide come in.
Great masses of blue, green and silver water
rushed in the Gap to fill to overflowing the
Basin and all its tributary streams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a wonderful sight!&rdquo; exclaimed Desir&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think the Wolf would have been
drowned,&rdquo; observed Ren&eacute;, watching the flood
of water, his eyes open very wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;d go up on the mountain and watch
it, not stay <i>in</i> it,&rdquo; said Priscilla in such a
scornful tone that Jack and Desir&eacute; smiled.</p>
<p class="tb">Several days later, they had passed through
many little towns and stopped in front of many
an isolated house where they disposed of many
or few of their wares. The dooryards were
gay with flowers, now; for no one was too poor
or too lazy to have a garden. Sometimes these
gardens were elaborate in shape, and of fair
size, with colors and varieties blended beautifully;
sometimes only a clump of cheerful red
or golden nasturtiums, clustering around a
stump or unsightly rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just look at that field!&rdquo; exclaimed Desir&eacute;,
suddenly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with it?&rdquo; inquired Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just red with strawberries!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s get out and pick some,&rdquo; proposed
Priscilla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think we might be able to sell
them in the next town if we gathered enough?&rdquo;
Desir&eacute; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps. There is a hotel, and lots of boarding
houses in Kentville; so I&rsquo;m told.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They left the horses to graze in the shade
of some trees, and the whole family, armed
with various sized dishes, scattered over the
field. After a couple of hours&rsquo; steady work,
they transferred the berries to a basket,
covered them with leaves, and continued on
their way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s going to sell them?&rdquo; questioned
Jack, when they were nearly to Kentville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never thought of that,&rdquo; confessed Desir&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; offered Priscilla. &ldquo;Let me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; chimed Ren&eacute;. &ldquo;I can sell berries
fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bit young, Renny,&rdquo; said Jack
with a smile; then, turning to Priscilla, he said,
&ldquo;All right, if you want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desir&eacute; looked a bit surprised at his willingness;
but Jack just drew the team up in front
of one of the smaller boarding houses and suggested,
&ldquo;Try here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>The little girl took the basket which he
handed down to her, walked boldly up the path
to the front door, and knocked. Through the
screen door they heard an annoyed voice say&mdash;&ldquo;Now,
I&rsquo;ve told you&mdash;Oh, what is it, child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A low conversation ensued, and Priscilla
flew out to the wagon again, displaying proudly
a couple of silver coins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll take some any time, she says; and
she knows other places where they would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would it be,&rdquo; inquired Desir&eacute; thoughtfully
as they went on, &ldquo;if we took time for
berry picking so long as they last; even if we
don&rsquo;t cover so much ground, it will be clear
profit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could,&rdquo; said Jack slowly; &ldquo;and it would
be better for us all to be out of the wagon for
a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; asked Desir&eacute;, &ldquo;hadn&rsquo;t we
better camp nearby, since we know we can find
quantities of berries here, and Kentville is a
pretty good market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack agreed.</p>
<p>A most delightful spot beside a noisy brook,
just outside the town, was selected as a camp
site; and for two whole weeks they scoured
the surrounding country for berries, taking
their harvest in to Kentville once a day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess these are the last,&rdquo; commented
Desir&eacute; rather regretfully, as they climbed up
a slope toward a bridge on their way home one
afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see a few down there,&rdquo; cried Priscilla,
starting toward the edge of the river
bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; called Jack, as she put one
foot part way down the bank to reach some
clusters beyond her, rather than walk a little
farther.</p>
<p>His warning came too late. Even as he
spoke, her foot slipped on the mud; and before
she could save herself, she slid all the way
down the soft slope and rolled into the river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><br />CHAPTER XIV
<br />TWO MISHAPS</h2>
<p>Fortunately the tide was out; so the
water was not very deep, and while Desir&eacute;
stood on the bridge and watched helplessly, and
Jack was looking for a place where he could
go to her assistance, Priscilla managed to get
out of the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come down,&rdquo; she called, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll fall
too. I&rsquo;ll be up soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the mud was very slippery; and again
and again she slid back, while Ren&eacute; shouted
with laughter, and clapped his hands. Even
Desir&eacute; had to smile; for Priscilla did look
funny, plastered with red mud, and dripping
with water. Jack again started toward her,
but Desir&eacute; held him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no use in two of you getting in
that state. She&rsquo;s in no danger, and since she
is lighter in weight than you, she stands a much
better chance of climbing up that bank.
Prissy,&rdquo; she called, &ldquo;crawl on your hands
and knees.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>The little girl obeyed, and finally reached the
top, where Jack stretched out a strong hand
to pull her over the edge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; she wailed, holding her
sticky arms out straight from her body, and
half blinded by the wet, muddy hair hanging
over her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew,&rdquo; said Desir&eacute;. &ldquo;Can you
walk home, do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so. I&rsquo;ll try; but&mdash;but&mdash;I lost all my
berries!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look like a big berry yourself, you&rsquo;re
so red,&rdquo; gurgled Ren&eacute;.</p>
<p>At least one of the party was enjoying the
incident to the utmost.</p>
<p>It took a long time to scrape and wash the
mud off poor Priscilla, and when the task was
accomplished they were exhausted.</p>
<p>While the others were occupied, Ren&eacute; had
been playing about by himself. Just as Priscilla
looked once more like herself, the little
boy ran toward the group crying at the top
of his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; demanded Jack, advancing
to meet the child and picking him up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bite!&rdquo; he wailed, holding out his finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What bit you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long, wiggly thing,&rdquo; sobbed the little
fellow. &ldquo;Ran away so fast.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Snake!&rdquo; said Desir&eacute;. &ldquo;Oh, Jack! What
shall we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened,&rdquo; said the boy, calmly
sitting down with the little fellow on his lap,
and examining the finger carefully. He found
the bite, and putting it to his lips, began to
suck the blood from it while Desir&eacute; helped hold
Ren&eacute; still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, do be careful,&rdquo; she begged anxiously;
&ldquo;be sure not to swallow any of it,&rdquo; as he
paused to dispose of what he had drawn from
the wound. &ldquo;Be quiet, Renny; brother is trying
to make you well; so you mustn&rsquo;t mind if
he hurts you a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Priscilla, with terrified eyes, stood looking
on helplessly until Desir&eacute; sent her for a box
of emergency supplies which she had prepared
before leaving Sissiboo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly think it was a poisonous snake,&rdquo;
said Jack, when he had done all he could; &ldquo;but
I suppose it is best to be on the safe side. I
had better take him in to Kentville to a doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; breathed Desir&eacute;, in great relief;
&ldquo;and let him see if you&rsquo;re all right too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>They hitched up the horses and drove into
the town, and while Jack and Desir&eacute; took Ren&eacute;
to the physician&rsquo;s office, Priscilla took the berries
they had gathered that day to her first
customer, Mrs. Auberge. They had become good
friends, and the little girl naturally told her
of the recent accidents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are no dangerous snakes right
around here,&rdquo; she said soothingly; &ldquo;but it does
no harm to have a doctor look the boy over.
So you&rsquo;re going on tomorrow? I&rsquo;ll miss you.
How would you like to stay with me for the
rest of the summer and help me with the tourists?
I&rsquo;ll pay you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have to ask Jack,&rdquo; replied the child
slowly, after a minute&rsquo;s thought. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come
back and let you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She met the others just coming out of the
doctor&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Renny and Jack are both all right,&rdquo; Desir&eacute;
cried joyfully to her little sister. &ldquo;Where have
you been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sold the berries to Mrs. Auberge; and&mdash;and&mdash;Jack&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wants me to stay here and help her
for the rest of the summer, and she&rsquo;ll pay me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desir&eacute; glanced quickly at Jack, who stood
regarding Priscilla very gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to stay?&rdquo; he inquired, finally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would bring in some money&mdash;I&rsquo;d be glad&mdash;that
is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t what I asked you, Prissy. I said
do you <i>want</i> to stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answer Jack, dear,&rdquo; urged Desir&eacute;, as the
child stood silent, hanging her head. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
be afraid to say just what you feel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t afraid,&rdquo; said Jack gently. &ldquo;Do
you want to stay with Mrs. Auberge, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Priscilla shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; replied her brother; &ldquo;that settles
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told her I&rsquo;d let her know&mdash;&rdquo; began the
little girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. Run back and thank her nicely
for her offer, but say that this summer we are
all going to stay together. We&rsquo;ll walk on
slowly, and you can catch up with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before they had gone far, they heard running
steps behind them; and Priscilla came
abreast, catching Jack by the hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See what she gave me,&rdquo; holding up a box
as she spoke; &ldquo;a game we can all play; and any
time I want to, I can stay and help her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very nice of her,&rdquo; said Desir&eacute;.
&ldquo;How wonderful people are to us everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing,&rdquo; remarked Jack that
night, &ldquo;that tomorrow we shall return to our
regular occupation and way of living. I feel
as if I had had enough excitement today to last
for the rest of the summer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of that kind, perhaps,&rdquo; agreed Desir&eacute;;
&ldquo;but there are other kinds; and those I hope
we&rsquo;ll meet. Did the doctor charge much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About half what we made on the berries,&rdquo;
smiled Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re still a little better off than when
we came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, some; but not much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, never mind; huckleberries are coming,
and we&rsquo;ll make it up on them,&rdquo; decided
Desir&eacute; hopefully. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it dear of Prissy
to be willing to go to work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she spoke of it again when I bade her
goodnight; but I said we could support her
until she is older. While it can be managed
otherwise, I hate to have her cooped up in a
strange house doing all kinds of odd jobs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t done so badly thus far, have
we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; but we haven&rsquo;t made anywhere near
enough to settle down somewhere and go to
school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the summer isn&rsquo;t over yet; and who
knows what will happen before winter comes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a hopeful little pal, Dissy,&rdquo; he said,
kissing her fondly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now we must begin to look for the Godet
house,&rdquo; said Desir&eacute;, pulling out her little blue
history the next morning, when they were on
the way to Wolfville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sorry we could get no information,
when we passed through Wilmot, about the first
Wistmore house in this country,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They lived on a sheep farm when they came
here from the States, and probably the place
looks like all others of its kind,&rdquo; replied Desir&eacute;,
poring over the book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the Godet house must be the other
side of Grand Pr&eacute;,&rdquo; observed Jack, looking
over her shoulder. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go there first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they turned off the main road and drove
down the hill, through the straggling village,
its long street bordered by spreading trees and
scattered white houses far back from the road.
The great marsh meadow, which was the Grand
Pr&eacute; of Longfellow&rsquo;s poem <i>Evangeline</i>, has been
set apart as a park, and is surrounded by a
fence. By going through a gate-house, one
enters the enclosure known as Acadian National
Park.</p>
<p>As the Wistmores descended the low broad
step on the park side of the gate-house, Ren&eacute;,
his eyes on the distant well of which he had
heard his sisters talking, put one foot right
into a very small flower-bordered pool at the
left of the step. Everyone turned at the sound
of the splash.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Renny!&rdquo; exclaimed Priscilla severely, &ldquo;I
never saw such a child for water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You rolled right into the river,&rdquo; retorted
the little boy, &ldquo;and got all red mud too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack and Desir&eacute; exchanged smiles.</p>
<p>For an hour the children wandered over the
interesting and beautiful meadowland, dotted
with large beds of gorgeous flowers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a sense of spaciousness, and of peace,
the place gives one,&rdquo; observed Desir&eacute;, as they
stood before the little chapel, gazing about
them. &ldquo;Look, Ren&eacute;, at the swallows&rsquo; nests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the walls, close to the buttress which supports
the sharply slanting roof, several nests
were plastered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is this the very same church mentioned
in <i>Evangeline</i>?&rdquo; inquired Priscilla, nearly
breaking her neck to look up at the belfry, surmounted
by a tall four-sided spire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No; but it is built on the site of that one,
and the row of willows you see down there to
the right grew on the main street of Grand
Pr&eacute;. The first settlers brought the shoots from
Normandy. The well we passed on our way
up is the same one from which the inhabitants
of the olden village obtained their water
supply. Just north of here is the Basin of
Minas, where the people embarked on the ship
which carried them away at the time of the
Expulsion. This meadowland all around us
was protected from the high tides by dykes
like you saw a few weeks ago in Bear River.
At one side of the Basin lies Cape Blomidon,
where the amethysts are found; and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where Glooscap lived,&rdquo; interrupted Ren&eacute;,
always glad to contribute to the narratives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; assented Jack, &ldquo;where Glooscap
lived. After the hay was cut from the
meadows,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;cattle were turned
in to graze until winter came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How queer it makes one feel to be here,&rdquo;
observed Desir&eacute; dreamily.</p>
<p>They missed Priscilla at that moment, and
looking around, saw her standing in front of
the large bronze statue of Evangeline, which
is in the centre of the park.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t look at all like I thought she
would,&rdquo; commented the little girl in disappointed
tones, as the others joined her. They
all gazed in silence for a moment at the sorrowful
figure, looking backward at the land she
was so reluctant to leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You probably like to think of her, as I do,
in a happier mood,&rdquo; said Desir&eacute;; &ldquo;but she
must have been pretty sad when she went
away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We had better go on now,&rdquo; decided Jack.
So they followed the little stream which twists
its way across the meadow; a mere thread in
some places, in others wide enough to be
bridged with single planks. Once it spread out
into a fair-sized pond, covered with water lilies
and guarded by a family of ducks who regarded
the visitors scornfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for <i>our</i> house,&rdquo; cried Desir&eacute; as they
drove onto the main road again. &ldquo;Please go
very slowly, Jack, so that we won&rsquo;t miss it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all peered eagerly out of the wagon;
and when they saw, up a little lane, a dilapidated-looking
building, they all exclaimed together&mdash;&ldquo;<i>That</i>
must be it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack drove as close as the underbrush would
allow, and they proceeded on foot until they
were standing before a small log cabin, windowless,
doorless, a huge flat stone for a doorstep,
and a chimney built of irregular stones.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><br />CHAPTER XV
<br />THE OLD GODET HOUSE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;No floors,&rdquo; observed Priscilla, peeking in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mere shell,&rdquo; said Jack; &ldquo;everything
rotted away but the walls and the chimney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how stout they are!&rdquo; exclaimed Desir&eacute;,
triumphantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll look at it again when we come back
this way, if you like,&rdquo; promised Jack presently;
&ldquo;but now I want to get on to Windsor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the remains of a garden back of
the cabin,&rdquo; commented Priscilla, as they drove
away. &ldquo;I can see three or four flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first seeds of which were doubtless
planted by our&mdash;how many times great-grandmother,
Jack?&rdquo; asked Desir&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. The &lsquo;greats&rsquo; always did puzzle
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Ren&eacute;, &ldquo;I always thought you
knowed <i>everything</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry to disappoint you, my boy,&rdquo; laughed
Jack; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Priscilla, &ldquo;I want to see
the place where you went to school, Jack.
Wasn&rsquo;t it here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ll show it to you when we come
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strange,&rdquo; commented Desir&eacute; to Jack,
&ldquo;that you never heard of or saw the place when
you were here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy smiled. &ldquo;I was far too busy going
to classes, preparing assignments, and coaching
some of the other fellows, to hunt up old
ruins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desir&eacute; was very quiet for the rest of the day,
but the next day, when they were camped near
the river Avon just beyond the town of Wolfville,
she said rather timidly to Jack:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose we could find out anywhere
who owns the Godet house now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly; but why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d just like to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her brother looked at her keenly before he
said&mdash;&ldquo;We can walk into town and see what
information we can get, if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose the children would be safe
if we left them?&rdquo; looking up at him doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so. Priscilla must begin to take a
little responsibility now. We&rsquo;ll have plenty of
time to get back before dinner time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>While Desir&eacute; got ready, Jack issued instructions
to the two children, closing with&mdash;&ldquo;Ren&eacute;,
you&rsquo;re to mind Priscilla; and Prissy, don&rsquo;t go
away from the wagon, or let Ren&eacute; out of your
sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had gone only a short distance when
Desir&eacute;, who had looked back several times, said&mdash;&ldquo;Jack,
would you mind very much if I let
you go on alone, and I went back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not; don&rsquo;t you feel well?&rdquo; he
inquired anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly; but&mdash;Prissy <i>is</i> pretty young to
be left with the wagon and the baby; and it
isn&rsquo;t as if you really needed me along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think they&rsquo;re perfectly safe, but if you&rsquo;d
feel better about it, go back by all means,&rdquo;
said her brother kindly.</p>
<p>So Desir&eacute; returned to the children, and
waited in a fever of suspense for Jack to come
back. With one eye on the long road, and the
other on her household, or rather wagonhold,
duties, she was ready to drop everything and
go to meet him as soon as his tall form appeared
in the distance.</p>
<p>At full speed she dashed along the highway,
raising quite a cloud of fine white dust, and
fell into Jack&rsquo;s arms outspread to stop her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good work, Dissy! All our riding hasn&rsquo;t
made you forget how to run. Remember the
races you and I used to have when we were
little, on that smooth path running along the
edge of the woods?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the day you fell over a stone and had
such a terrible nosebleed? How frightened I
was!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had lots of good times together when
we were kids, didn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; asked Jack, laying
his arm affectionately across her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We surely did; but why say &lsquo;when we were
kids?&rsquo; We do now, too, only they are a different
kind of times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a different kind of race,&rdquo; added Jack,
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what did you do in town?&rdquo; asked the
girl, unable to restrain her curiosity any longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rambled about a bit first, asking a question
here and there, and finally ended up at
the house of Judge Herbine. He&rsquo;s a fine old
man, Desir&eacute;; you&rsquo;d like him. As he is quite
a story-teller, and very much interested in our
affairs, it took some time to get the information
I was after; but at last I succeeded in
finding out that the house apparently belongs
to no one. Some years ago a man from the
States wanted to buy the site for a summer
home, but when he investigated and found that
there wasn&rsquo;t a clear title to the property, he
decided not to take it. I don&rsquo;t really understand
it, but it&rsquo;s something about some papers
that are missing, have been for years and
years back. Nobody else wanted it, so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We can take it ourselves,&rdquo; concluded
Desir&eacute;.</p>
<p>The boy stood stock still in the road, and
looked at his sister in frank dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth do you mean!&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I said. If it belongs to nobody,
we, being the Godets&rsquo; descendants, can surely
take it. Who&rsquo;d have a better right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack looked more and more puzzled, as he
said&mdash;&ldquo;What would you do with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Do</i> with it? Why, live in it, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy regarded her with such a worried
look that she laughed outright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m perfectly sane, Jack. My plan is this.
We&rsquo;ll have to live somewhere during the winter;
and if we board, we&rsquo;ll use up all the money
we make this summer. With this as our headquarters,
during unpleasant weather we could
make day trips as we planned, and send Prissy
to school every day in Wolfville. Or possibly
you could get some kind of a job in Windsor
for the winter, and I could take charge of the
wagon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But nobody could possibly live in that
cabin,&rdquo; objected Jack, brushing away a persistently
hovering bee. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hopeless.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed it isn&rsquo;t hopeless. I agree with you
that no one could live in it the way it is now,
but with new floors and a couple of partitions,
it would be fine. You admitted that the walls
were stout, and the chimney perfect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With help, I could put down floors&mdash;&rdquo;
began Jack half to himself, after a moment&rsquo;s
consideration. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to think this out
more carefully, though, and talk it over again.&rdquo;
And he added hurriedly as they got near the
wagon, and Priscilla dashed out to meet them,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say anything yet before the children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same afternoon Jack went again to town,
and did not return until supper time. Priscilla
was curious to know what he did there, but he
gave such absurd answers to her questions that
she finally gave up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not <i>ever</i> going to ask you another question,&rdquo;
she announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not until next time,&rdquo; teased Jack, ruffling
up her hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you are as curious as Prissy,&rdquo;
he said later on to Desir&eacute;, after the children
were asleep.</p>
<p>August had come in with a cool wind from
over Fundy, and after darkness fell, the chill
was more noticeable; so Jack had built a small
camp fire, and he and Desir&eacute; were sitting beside
it on a pile of cedar boughs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; admitted Desir&eacute;. &ldquo;I must confess
that I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went to see a young carpenter that the
judge recommended to me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About floors?&rdquo; asked Desir&eacute; eagerly, twisting
around so quickly to look directly into his
face that the pile of boughs swayed threateningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out, Dissy!&rdquo; warned her brother.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have us both in the fire if you don&rsquo;t
sit still. Yes, about floors, and partitions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s busy on one of the farms now, but
when the crops are in he&rsquo;ll do the work for
us at a price that we can afford to pay. That
is, I think we can if we do well for the rest of
the summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll just <i>have</i> to,&rdquo; decreed Desir&eacute;,
tossing a couple of pine cones into the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The judge is a good old scout. Seemed so
interested in us that I told him what we were
doing, or rather trying to do, and he was awfully
keen about seeing the rest of you. So he&rsquo;s
coming out tomorrow to lunch&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow!&rdquo; exclaimed Desir&eacute;. &ldquo;Why, I
thought you were anxious to get on to Windsor;
and we&rsquo;ve already lost a day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know; I don&rsquo;t know just why I hung
around here, but it just seemed as if we were
meant to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to <i>lunch</i>, Jack,&rdquo; she added, in dire
dismay. &ldquo;What made you ask him to a meal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. The invitation was out before
I thought. But you would have asked him, too.
He seems so kind of lonely, and he says he
dotes on picnics. You can manage something
simple; can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; the boy asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try hard, of course. Do you suppose
you could catch a few fish in the morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably, and I saw some ripe huckleberries
as I came along this afternoon. The youngsters
can gather some of those, and we&rsquo;ll get
along all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children were delighted at the prospect
of &ldquo;company,&rdquo; and immediately after breakfast,
Jack escorted them, armed with a tin
pail and a couple of cups, across a field to the
berry bushes loaded with blue fruit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the pail is filled, go right back the
way we came, and take the berries to Desir&eacute;,&rdquo;
he instructed, as he set out in a different direction
for the river, with his fish pole. The
banks of the sparkling stream were pink with
masses of wild roses, freshly opened and wet
with dew.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Desir&eacute; would be crazy over these,&rdquo; he
thought. &ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll take some to her when I
go back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour&rsquo;s fishing resulted in enough fish for
a meal; and after cutting an armful of roses,
Jack returned to camp. The children had
reached there ahead of him, and were busy
making things ready for the eagerly awaited
guest.</p>
<p>Desir&eacute; had laid on the ground, in a shady
spot, a red-bordered tablecloth, anchored it at
each corner with a stone concealed by a pile
of pine cones. She greeted Jack&rsquo;s offering with
enthusiasm&mdash;&ldquo;Just what we need for the centre
of the table. Prissy, get an empty fruit can
to put them in, and lay some big ferns around
it. I must attend to my biscuits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was wonderful what good things Desir&eacute;
could cook on the little camp stove, which they
really had not felt able to afford when they
saw it in Yarmouth. &ldquo;It will pay for itself
very soon,&rdquo; she had argued; &ldquo;for we can&rsquo;t live
on cold food all the time; and eating in restaurants
is awfully expensive.&rdquo; Jack had approved;
so the stove and even a little oven to
set on top of it, when needed, had been added
to old Simon&rsquo;s outfit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>About twelve o&rsquo;clock a Ford coup&eacute; was seen
in the distance, and soon came to a stop beside
the Wistmores who, one and all, stood in
a row in front of the camp. A thin little man
with heavy white hair got nimbly out of the
car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my family, Judge Herbine,&rdquo; said
Jack; &ldquo;Desir&eacute;, Priscilla, and Ren&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very glad, indeed, to know you all,&rdquo; replied
the judge, bowing low with old-fashioned
courtesy, but gazing searchingly at each one
over the tops of the glasses which he wore so
far out on his nose that it was a miracle that
they stayed on at all. Priscilla was so fascinated
by them that she could hardly keep her
eyes off them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have lunch right away,&rdquo; announced
Desir&eacute;; &ldquo;so please take your places at the
table. This is yours, Judge,&rdquo; indicating the
side facing the road, where a cushion had been
placed. The others sat on the ground.</p>
<p>The fish which Jack had fried over a camp
fire, while Desir&eacute; finished her biscuits, were
done to a turn; and the judge did full justice
to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These biscuits are mighty fine,&rdquo; he commented,
&ldquo;and you say you made them on that
little gadget of a stove? Marvelous! Marvelous!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>After the huckleberries and some wafers
which Desir&eacute; had taken from their stock were
disposed of, the guest insisted upon helping
clear up. He was a lively little man, and skipped
hither and thither, carrying dishes, picking up
papers, and making himself generally useful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for a visit,&rdquo; he said, settling himself
beside a tall pine, leaning back against its
trunk, and stretching his legs, clad in cream-colored
crash, straight out in front of him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><br />CHAPTER XVI
<br />A NEW FRIEND</h2>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re going to try to live in the old
Godet house this winter&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>are</i> we?&rdquo; cried Priscilla, throwing herself
on Desir&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh!&rdquo; shrieked Ren&eacute; joyfully, not very
clear as to what the rejoicing was about, but
determined to have his full share in it anyway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I let the cat out of the bag?&rdquo; inquired
the judge, startled at the effect of his question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had not yet told the children,&rdquo; replied
Jack; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s quite all right, for they would
have known soon, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry&mdash;sorry. You two youngsters just forget
what I said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man talked in a rapid, jerky fashion
which reminded Desir&eacute; of the way a robin runs
along, a few steps very fast, stops up short,
and then repeats the process.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I was going to say, where do you expect
to house your team this winter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack and Desir&eacute; looked at each other in dismay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought of that,&rdquo; said the boy
slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, <i>I</i> did. Got an empty barn at my place&mdash;no
good to me&mdash;Ford is lost in it&mdash;plenty of
room for your horses and wagon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll let&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I know just what you&rsquo;re&mdash;going to
say&mdash;and I <i>won&rsquo;t</i>. But if you&rsquo;d&mdash;feel better
about it&mdash;let this good sister of yours&mdash;make
me some biscuits once in a while. Don&rsquo;t get
this kind very often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d just love to,&rdquo; replied Desir&eacute; warmly,
while Jack tried to express his thanks, to which
the old man refused to listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going from here?&rdquo; continued
the judge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right on to Halifax, then back again,&rdquo; replied
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I was thinking&mdash;while we were eating&mdash;know
how to make things out of birch
bark&mdash;and out of pine cones?&rdquo; turning to Desir&eacute;.
&ldquo;No? Then I&rsquo;ll show you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scrambling lightly to his feet, and followed
by the young Wistmores, he darted across the
road to a large birch tree; and drawing a knife
from his pocket, showed them how to obtain
strips of bark without injuring the tree. Returning
to the camp, he ordered the two children
to gather up a lot of cones. The rest of
the afternoon was spent in learning to make
boxes, baskets, and picture frames.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;re lots of tourists in Halifax&mdash;always
looking for souvenirs&mdash;at railroad station, cab
stands, and such. Wharf, too, is a good place
to offer this stuff. No reason why you two girls
shouldn&rsquo;t do that&mdash;perfectly safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m going home,&rdquo; he announced suddenly
at about five o&rsquo;clock. &ldquo;Had a good time.
See you often this winter. I&rsquo;ll keep an eye on
that boy who is going to fix up your cabin&mdash;ready
when you come back this way&mdash;if you
don&rsquo;t come too soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he <i>funny</i>?&rdquo; commented Priscilla, as
the Ford drove out of sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But charming,&rdquo; added Desir&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I like him a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, too, like him,&rdquo; echoed Ren&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow,&rdquo; said Desir&eacute;, &ldquo;I want to gather
lots of bark and cones, and while we&rsquo;re on the
road I can make up baskets and boxes. Then
when we get near enough to Halifax, we&rsquo;ll pick
huckleberries to fill some of them, and wild
flowers for the rest&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll sell &rsquo;em and make heaps of
money,&rdquo; finished the practical Priscilla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get bunches of cat tails, too,&rdquo; continued
Desir&eacute;.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And later in the season, pretty berries,&rdquo;
said Priscilla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And wintergreen&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And nuts&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And soon you won&rsquo;t need my poor efforts
at all,&rdquo; concluded Jack, with a half smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t, please, Jack, even in fun,&rdquo;
begged Desir&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d need you even if you never earned a
cent!&rdquo; cried Priscilla, throwing her arms
around Jack&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>Ren&eacute;, attempting to imitate her, due to the
wagon&rsquo;s passing over a rut, succeeded only in
falling violently on his brother&rsquo;s shoulder. The
combined assault nearly forced Jack forward
out of the seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take your word for it, hereafter,&rdquo; he
gasped, when order was once more restored.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t illustrate again, I beg of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">A week later the Wistmore family drove into
Halifax.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall have to spend most of the day buying
supplies,&rdquo; said Jack, as they passed the
citadel. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put the wagon up somewhere,
and you and the children can look about while
I&rsquo;m busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; protested Desir&eacute;, &ldquo;the boxes of berries,
and flowers&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>She had carried out the plan formulated at
Wolfville, and had a number of really artistic
boxes of choice fruit, partly covered with tiny
ferns, and several odd baskets in which dainty
wild flowers were set in moss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate to have you hanging around offering
things for sale,&rdquo; objected Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t afford to be proud that way,
dear. It is a perfectly respectable thing to do,
and I do so want to be a help&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if you weren&rsquo;t always,&rdquo; ejaculated the
boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think the station might be the best
place to start; so drive us over there like a
good boy,&rdquo; urged Desir&eacute;.</p>
<p>So Jack kept Ren&eacute; with him, and, with many
misgivings, left the girls standing near the
steps which lead down from the station to the
cab platform. The taxi drivers were too busy
trying to outdo one another in securing fares
to pay much attention to the girls; for a train
had just come in. The first few travelers who
hurried through the station to secure a taxi
did not even see the little saleswomen. When
another group appeared, Desir&eacute; stepped forward
just as they were getting into a cab.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like&mdash;&rdquo; she began timidly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>A haughty-looking elderly woman, who
seemed to be the leader of the party, brushed
her aside with a curt &ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scarlet with embarrassment, Desir&eacute; shrank
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind her, Dissy,&rdquo; said Priscilla,
hugging her sister&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s ugly mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; was the only word Desir&eacute; could
utter just then. It took all the courage she was
able to muster to approach the next travelers,
a fat man and two women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you care to buy a souvenir?&rdquo; asked
Desir&eacute;, her heart beating very fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless my soul, no!&rdquo; replied the man, not
unkindly but very definitely. &ldquo;Too much luggage
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only the thoughts of helping Jack urged
the girl to persevere. Trembling, dripping with
perspiration, she stopped a couple of women
who shook their heads before she could get a
word out. Seeing the look of disappointment
on her face, the younger of the two held out a
coin, saying&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want your wares, but
take this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stung to the quick, but realizing that no injury
was intended, Desir&eacute; refused and walked
away, ready to cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have taken it if I&rsquo;d been you,&rdquo; commented
Priscilla.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you wouldn&rsquo;t, Prissy. We do not
<i>beg</i>. But I guess nobody wants our souvenirs&mdash;and
I thought them so pretty. We&rsquo;d better
try to find the Public Gardens, where Jack
told us to meet him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the station is a bad place, anyway,&rdquo;
said Priscilla. &ldquo;The people are in too much of
a hurry, and they did all have a lot of baggage.
Maybe we can find somewhere else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By asking directions a number of times, they
arrived at the Public Gardens&mdash;the big iron
gates opening into acres of gay flower beds,
rare and valuable trees, winding streams, artistic
bridges. They were about to enter, when
a man who, at a safe distance, had been watching
them in the station, and who had followed
them to the Gardens, now hurried forward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><br />CHAPTER XVII
<br />AN OLD ENEMY</h2>
<p>Pushing rudely between the two girls, the
stranger succeeded, by means of a skillful bit
of elbow play, in knocking the souvenirs out
of their hands. As if to avoid stepping on the
scattered berries and flowers, he took a couple
of quick side steps, planting his huge feet directly
upon them, and thereby ruining them
completely. It was all done so quickly that the
girls hardly realized what had happened until
they stood looking down at the remains of many
days of labor.</p>
<p>Desir&eacute; was quite speechless, and seemed momentarily
paralyzed. Not so Priscilla, whose
quick eyes followed the stranger, striding
away over one of the bridges in the Garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dissy,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s that <i>same
man</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>same man</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one who fought Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does <i>look</i> a lot like him, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s him all right! The mean old pig!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Prissy! It was an accident.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t either, and now we can&rsquo;t make any
money to take to Jack.&rdquo; Excitedly she burst
into tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, dear,&rdquo; begged Desir&eacute;. &ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t
act like babies every time something goes
wrong. We&rsquo;ll just start over again. These
didn&rsquo;t cost anything, and it will be easy to
make new ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo; asked Jack, who had
come up behind them.</p>
<p>Both girls explained at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the fellow now?&rdquo; demanded the
boy, his jaw set, his eyes flashing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went over that bridge,&rdquo; pointed Priscilla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother about him,&rdquo; urged Desir&eacute;.
&ldquo;You might get arrested. Let&rsquo;s go back to
the wagon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Struggling between the wish to avenge the
wrong to his little sisters, and the conviction
that it was perhaps wiser to avoid conflict in a
strange city, he turned abruptly away from the
big iron gates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we going next?&rdquo; asked Desir&eacute;,
as they walked along the street toward the
place where the wagon had been left.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I bought all the stock we need, and I
thought, since Simon always did, we&rsquo;d go on
down the South Shore a ways and then come
back here to start for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Home!</i>&rdquo; concluded Desir&eacute;, &ldquo;and what fun
we&rsquo;ll have settling down in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More fun in a wag&rsquo;n,&rdquo; declared Ren&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d holler all right, when the snow blew
in on you,&rdquo; said Priscilla.</p>
<p>Jack hardly heard what they were saying,
so puzzled and disturbed was he over the reappearance
of his enemy. Was the man following
them, or was the meeting purely accidental?
Had he been tampering with the horses the
night Priscilla roused them? If the fellow were
bent on revenge, they were likely to suffer from
the effects of his anger and jealousy almost
any time.</p>
<p>The next morning they were following the
very irregular South Shore line along the Atlantic;
past ragged points, around deep bays,
through tangles of woodland, then back beside
the yellow sands again. Numerous offshore
islands looked so inviting that Priscilla
was always wishing they could drive out to
them. As they rounded St. Margaret&rsquo;s Bay,
the sunshine was brilliant; but almost without
warning, a mile farther on, they were completely
enveloped in fog which cut off all view
of the ocean.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do be very careful, Jack,&rdquo; pleaded Desir&eacute;
nervously, as they almost felt their way around
an especially blind curve. &ldquo;Someone might run
into us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They reached Chester in safety, and spent
some time looking about that busy little town.
The souvenir shop up the hill above the Lovett
House especially attracted Priscilla, and it was
with great reluctance that she left it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have money enough to buy everything
I wanted there,&rdquo; she said, looking longingly
back at it.</p>
<p>In a few minutes they missed Ren&eacute;, who had
been lagging along behind them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That boy is hopeless,&rdquo; groaned Jack, as
they retraced their steps to look for him.</p>
<p>Not very far back they discovered him, leaning
over the edge of a cobblestone well, trying
to lower the heavy bucket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thirsty,&rdquo; he explained, as Jack detached
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you might have fallen in!&rdquo; said Desir&eacute;
severely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what we can do,&rdquo; proposed
Priscilla; &ldquo;tie a rope to him, like you do to
a little dog, and I&rsquo;ll lead him. I saw a lady at
Halifax with a little boy fastened that way,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The proposal called forth a howl from Ren&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t be tied like a dog! Won&rsquo;t have
Prissy lead me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s go on now before we get into
any more difficulties,&rdquo; said Jack, starting for
the shed where he had left the wagon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is Mahone Bay,&rdquo; he told them, as
they gazed out over the large arm of the ocean
upon which Chester is located; &ldquo;and all this
section was once a great retreat for pirates.
There are so many islands where they hid their
booty, and so many little bays and inlets where
they could take refuge if pursued.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to go out there and see pirates,&rdquo; announced
Ren&eacute;, as Jack tightened the reins, and
Dolly and Dapple began to move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are no pirates there now,&rdquo; said Priscilla
in a disgusted tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and see. <i>I&rsquo;m</i> going to be a pirate when
I grow up. I think they&rsquo;re <i>fine</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing you didn&rsquo;t give us that
piece of information before, Jack,&rdquo; laughed
Desir&eacute;, &ldquo;or we should have been swimming out
to find Renny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not very far beyond Chester, they ran into
fog again. The road was winding, and very
much up and down hill; and as they were about
to round a curve near Lunenburg, a heavy automobile
loomed up suddenly at their left, out of
the grey blanket which enfolded the landscape.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><br />CHAPTER XVIII
<br />A COLLISION</h2>
<p>Jack turned aside as quickly and as far
as he dared, but the machine struck the side
of the wagon, ripped off a wheel, and disappeared
into the gloom. The children were
thrown violently to the floor of the wagon, and
Desir&eacute; against the side; but Jack managed to
keep his seat. The horses stopped instantly, and
stood quiet like the intelligent, well-mannered
animals that they were. To the accompaniment
of Ren&eacute;&rsquo;s cries, Jack got his little family out
of the tilting wagon and took stock of their
injuries. Priscilla had a bad nosebleed, and
Desir&eacute; a bruised arm. Ren&eacute; was only badly
frightened, and Jack himself entirely uninjured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We certainly can be very thankful,&rdquo;
breathed Desir&eacute; with relief, after first aid had
been given.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We certainly can,&rdquo; agreed Jack fervently,
going to examine the condition of the wagon;
&ldquo;we were very lucky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can we do with it?&rdquo; inquired Desir&eacute;.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fortunately we&rsquo;re not very far from Lunenburg,&rdquo;
he replied, &ldquo;and I suppose I can get
it fixed there; but it will mean quite a delay,
I imagine. If the fog would only lift so that
we could see something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not stay right here until it does?&rdquo;
proposed Desir&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should you be afraid to stay here with the
children while I walked to town?&rdquo; began Jack.
&ldquo;It would save time if I could get the work
started today&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not afraid for us, Jack; but for you. Something
might hit you. Suppose another automobile
should come along!&rdquo; She shuddered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then we&rsquo;ll try to get the wagon just
off the road, and make ourselves as comfortable
as we can until the fog is gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With much difficulty, and many pauses for
rest, they succeeded in getting the wagon off
the road.</p>
<p>It was a tiresome afternoon, and seemed
many hours longer than it really was. Just
about six o&rsquo;clock the grey blanket was whisked
away as suddenly as if someone had picked it
up, and the land was flooded with late afternoon
sunshine. On one side of them were fields
with groups of trees here and there; on the
other, a wide beach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why not camp in this field?&rdquo; asked Desir&eacute;,
as the children darted across to play in the
sand. &ldquo;If we&rsquo;re going to be held up for a day
or two, this is probably as good a place as
any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack agreed. So after charging the children
not to go into the water, they set about making
a permanent camp. It was too late to go to
town that night, but early the next morning
Jack took the broken wheel and started out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can have it the day after tomorrow,&rdquo; he
announced upon his return, which Desir&eacute; assured
him was &ldquo;not so bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">The two days passed very pleasantly. Twice
a day, much to Ren&eacute;&rsquo;s delight, they all went in
bathing. Playing in the sand became almost
as much of a joy to the older ones as to the
children, and they laid out wonderful towns
across the beach. In the middle of the day,
when it was too hot near the water, they spent
their time in the grove, and made friends with
the squirrels who were busy laying in their
stores for the winter. The little creatures got
so tame that they would venture into the very
laps of the invaders of their domain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for the road again!&rdquo; cried Jack, on
the evening of the second day, as he put the
new wheel on the wagon. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go to bed
early, and get started as soon as it is light.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>Just after daybreak, he came to the wagon
where Desir&eacute; was collecting supplies for their
breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dissy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Dolly is very sick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sick! Oh, Jack, what <i>shall</i> we do!&rdquo; cried
Desir&eacute; in dismay. Difficulties did seem to be
coming too thick and fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made her as comfortable as I can, but
I don&rsquo;t know what to do next. I&rsquo;ll have to go
to town for help. Give me a sandwich to eat
on the way&mdash;I can&rsquo;t wait for breakfast. You
and the children keep away from her until I
get back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few minutes Jack disappeared down the
road leading to Lunenburg, puzzling over the
finding of a pan half filled with bran mash
which he had discovered near Dolly. Since he
could not arrive at a satisfactory explanation,
he wisely decided to keep the discovery to himself.</p>
<p>Desir&eacute; gave the children their breakfast, and
sent them out on the sand, she herself remaining
where she could watch them and keep an
eye on the wagon. It seemed hours after Jack
had gone when up the road she could see the
broad bulk of a team of oxen plodding slowly
toward her. As they came closer, she saw that
they were pulling one of the flat wooden wagons
used for hauling stone. On the boards sat Jack
and another man; the driver was walking at
the animals&rsquo; heads. Jack got off and came hurriedly
toward her, after directing the driver
to the end of the field where the sick horse lay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The doctor thinks he&rsquo;ll have to take Dolly
to his place; so they brought an ox team
along,&rdquo; he explained. Then before Desir&eacute; had
time to reply, he dashed off to join the other
two men.</p>
<p>Half an hour later poor Dolly, reclining on
the ox cart, was ready for her ride to Lunenburg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think she will get well; but not right off.
She must have ate something very bad,&rdquo; said
Dr. Myers, a stout German, mopping his brow
with a big blue handkerchief. &ldquo;You come see
me&mdash;say&mdash;next day after tomorrow; then I
maybe can tell you how long.&rdquo; He ran clumsily
down the road to join his patient.</p>
<p>Jack sat down beside Desir&eacute;, and for a long
moment they looked at each other without
speaking. The children, who had left their play
to become spectators of the moving, had returned
to the beach at Desir&eacute;&rsquo;s direction, and
were now so busy constructing a sea wall that
they were oblivious to all else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What next, Jack?&rdquo; asked Desir&eacute; at last,
laying her hand over his.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><br />CHAPTER XIX
<br />POOR DOLLY!</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew,&rdquo; was the boy&rsquo;s sad reply
to his sister&rsquo;s question.</p>
<p>Fired by the sight of his deep depression,
Desir&eacute; put her wits to work to find a way out
of this latest catastrophe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I could get some work in the shipyards
in town,&rdquo; began her brother before she
had arrived at any solution of the problem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if Dolly gets well in a few days, would
that pay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she will&mdash;at least not so as
to be ready for the road. You see, Dissy, it&rsquo;s
going to take an awful lot of what we&rsquo;ve made
so far to pay the doctor; and while we&rsquo;re held
up here, nothing is coming in, and living expenses
go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could get a job in the yards for two
or three weeks, it would mean a lot to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would stay here, and you&rsquo;d go back
and forth every day?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is if you wouldn&rsquo;t be afraid&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I shouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only half an hour&rsquo;s walk, and we can
camp down here cheaper than living in town.
In October we should settle down in Wolfville;
for it will be altogether too cold to camp after
that time. If I could get work for two or three
weeks, then we&rsquo;ll start back for Halifax, and
get to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Our</i> house just about in time,&rdquo; concluded
Desir&eacute; gaily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How proudly you say that,&rdquo; smiled Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>am</i> proud of it. Well, we&rsquo;ll follow out
your plan then; and while I get dinner you
might tell the children what we&rsquo;ve decided.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better wait until we see whether I get the
job or not,&rdquo; advised her brother. &ldquo;It will be
hard on you, poor kid, having to manage everything
here while I&rsquo;m gone all day long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not half so hard, dear, as your having to
go to work at something you don&rsquo;t know anything
about. I&rsquo;m used to my work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following afternoon, Jack returned from
town, and immediately sought out Desir&eacute; who
was sitting under a clump of birches mending
one of Priscilla&rsquo;s dresses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good news, Dissy!&rdquo; he cried, dropping
down at her feet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a job.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack, that&rsquo;s great! Tell me all about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I first went into town, I stopped at
Dr. Myers&rsquo; and saw Dolly. She&rsquo;s lots better,
but Doc said she ought to stay there another
week. It&rsquo;s expensive, but it would be more so
if we lost her; so I don&rsquo;t want to take any
chances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When she&rsquo;s ready to come back, he&rsquo;ll bring
her out here; and he said to let her roam about
the field for another week, and then drive her
half a day at a time for a while. After that,
he says she&rsquo;ll be all right again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s better than we feared at first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes indeed. I thought for a while that poor
old Dolly was a goner. And how hard it would
have been to tell good old Simon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what about your job?&rdquo; For Jack&rsquo;s
eyes were on the expanse of blue ocean, where
the sparkling ripples from a distance looked
like silver confetti tossed up into the air and
then allowed to fall back upon the restless surface
of the water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. I asked directions from the doctor,
and went over to the shipyard. My, but
it&rsquo;s an interesting and busy place, Dissy! Ships
just begun, others with their ribs all showing
and looking like the carcass of a chicken used to
when the kids got through with it; some being
painted, some out in the harbor waiting for
masts, and others all ready for the deep sea.
I found the man who hires the help, and he
didn&rsquo;t seem at all interested in me&mdash;said he
wasn&rsquo;t going to take anyone on at present. I&rsquo;ll
admit I was awfully disappointed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old Jack!&rdquo; murmured his sister sympathetically,
laying down her work to put her
arms around him, much as she would have
done to Ren&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as I was leaving, who should come
lumbering into the office but Dr. Myers. &lsquo;Did
you get it?&rsquo; he asked. When I said I did not,
he grabbed my arm, turned me around, and
marched me back to the desk where Mr. Libermann
was sitting. &lsquo;I send you this boy to get
a job,&rsquo; he cried angrily. &lsquo;For why you not gif
him one? I know you haf extra work for these
few weeks.&rsquo; Mr. Libermann seemed a bit taken
back, and stammered&mdash;&lsquo;I did not know he was
friend of yours. I&rsquo;ll see what I can do if&mdash;&rsquo;
&lsquo;You&rsquo;d better!&rsquo; shouted the doctor, shaking his
fist under Herr Libermann&rsquo;s nose. He got up
from the desk and disappeared into some quarters
at the back of the building, glad to escape,
I think, for even a few minutes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He owe me too many kindnesses,&rsquo; grumbled
the doctor, &lsquo;for him to refuse what I ask.&rsquo;
Presently Mr. Libermann returned with the welcome
news that I was taken on as an extra
hand for three weeks, and could start tomorrow.
So once more we are&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the road to prosperity!&rdquo; finished Desir&eacute;,
giving him a hug and taking up her sewing
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly prosperity, I&rsquo;m afraid; but at
least the means of existence,&rdquo; laughed Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The funny part of the performance,&rdquo; he
went on, &ldquo;is that Dr. Myers did not tell me to
say to Mr. Libermann that he had sent me; and
that gentleman didn&rsquo;t have courage to remind
him of the fact when he got so excited over my
being turned down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children were delighted when they heard
that another three weeks were to be spent in
that pleasant spot, but deplored the absence of
their playfellow, Jack. Unaccustomed to work
of the heavy kind that was required of him in
the shipyard, he was naturally very tired when
he returned at night; and Desir&eacute; tried to prevent
the younger ones from making any demands
at all upon him. She was careful, too,
to keep unpleasant topics and worries from
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>The days were lonely for her; their simple
housekeeping was soon done, and she could not
play with the children all the time. So in desperation,
one day, she took the cover off the
box of articles saved from their old home, and
hunted through until she found Jack&rsquo;s first
year high school books.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t go to school,&rdquo; she decided, &ldquo;I
can at least study a little by myself. I won&rsquo;t
bother Jack now, but later he will help me
over the things I can&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the days did not drag so slowly.</p>
<p>The doctor kept an eye on Jack, and at unexpected
times dropped into the yards to see
him. In spite of the difference in their ages,
the two became good friends; and both were
genuinely sorry when the end of their companionship
arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The doctor wants me to be on the lookout
for a certain kind of ox on the way back to
Halifax,&rdquo; said Jack, the night before they
broke camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halifax?&rdquo; said Priscilla. &ldquo;I thought we
were going to Bridgeriver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bridgewater,&rdquo; corrected Desir&eacute;, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, a river is water,&rdquo; persisted Priscilla,
who was always reluctant to admit that
she had made a mistake; and disliked very
much to be laughed at.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes it is red mud,&rdquo; suggested Jack
mischievously. &ldquo;Eh, Prissy?&rdquo; drawing a
feathery grass blade across the back of her
neck as she sat in front of him sorting shells
and stones.</p>
<p>The children had gathered a bushel or more
of beach treasures that they &ldquo;simply <i>must</i> take
with them,&rdquo; but Jack had decreed that only
one small box could be incorporated in their
luggage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it best to get back to Wolfville
as soon as possible,&rdquo; explained her brother
seriously when she did not respond to his good-natured
teasing. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so very warm now
nights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the ox?&rdquo; asked Desir&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A friend of the doctor&rsquo;s, in fact the man
who came out here after Dolly, has lost one
of his&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lost!&rdquo; exclaimed Priscilla disdainfully.
&ldquo;How on earth could one lose an ox?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The way we nearly lost Dolly,&rdquo; replied
Jack briefly, before continuing his explanation
to Desir&eacute;. &ldquo;And naturally he wants to buy a
perfect match for the remaining one. He has
been around the nearby country, but for some
reason&mdash;I believe his wife is ill, or something
like that&mdash;he can&rsquo;t go far to hunt one up. So
the doctor is helping him, and he thought I
might just happen to see one on the way to
Halifax.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How would you know if you did?&rdquo; demanded
Priscilla, with some scorn, still
annoyed at having to abandon so many of her
marine souvenirs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Myers took me to examine the surviving
animal, and I looked him over closely and wrote
down a description besides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read it to us, Jack,&rdquo; suggested Desir&eacute;;
&ldquo;and then we can all be on the watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Jack read his notes, and when they went
to bed they were all hopeful of finding the required
animal on their trip back to Halifax.</p>
<p class="tb">A couple of days later they were driving
along the edge of St. Margaret&rsquo;s Bay, when
Desir&eacute; clutched Jack&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where, and at what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Away over there, in the far corner of that
field. Aren&rsquo;t those oxen? And so many of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack stopped the horses and stood up, shading
his eyes with his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better go and look at them&mdash;that
is, if they are for sale?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose I had, but I wonder how one gets
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be a road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and see,&rdquo; offered Priscilla.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; chirped Ren&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll drive on a bit first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little farther on, a narrow road led far
back in the direction of the field in which the
oxen were located, and from that side, farm
buildings could be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ll try to take the wagon
in there,&rdquo; decided Jack, surveying the road
doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might make a sale,&rdquo; suggested Priscilla,
always with an eye for business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And break an axle in one of those holes.
No, I&rsquo;ll walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children clamored to go too, but Jack
refused all company; so they watched him pick
his way carefully along until he reached the end
of the road which evidently terminated in a
barnyard. It was tiresome waiting; so Desir&eacute;
let the children get out to gather some cat tails
which were growing along the edge of a tiny
roadside stream.</p>
<p>They were so busy that Jack was right upon
them before they were aware of his approach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ve found what we&rsquo;re looking for,&rdquo;
he announced jubilantly when he came within
earshot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Really, Jack!&rdquo; cried Desir&eacute;, almost falling
off the seat of the wagon in her excitement,
while the children threw themselves on him,
flinging the cat tails far and wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As far as I can see, he&rsquo;s a perfect match.
The man raises them for sale. I gave him the
doctor&rsquo;s address, and he promised to get in
touch with him at once. However, I&rsquo;ll write a
letter too, and mail it in the first town we come
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it nice,&rdquo; said Desir&eacute;, when they were
once more on their way, &ldquo;that you were able
to do something for the doctor in return for his
kindness to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and do you know, Dissy, people have
been most awfully kind to us all summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They surely have. I never dreamed we&rsquo;d
make so many friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; said Priscilla bluntly; &ldquo;some of
them weren&rsquo;t very nice. Those folks in Halifax
were just horrid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; ordered Desir&eacute; severely; for she
had never repeated to Jack her unpleasant experiences
in that city.</p>
<p>Jack looked searchingly at her flushed face,
but said nothing more about it until they were
alone that evening; then he insisted on hearing
the whole story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never again!&rdquo; he decreed, &ldquo;shall you or
Prissy try to sell things on the street.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re all peddlers, Jack dear; you can&rsquo;t
get away from that fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dissy,&rdquo; said her brother, smiling, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll
get to be as much of an arguer as Prissy if
you&rsquo;re not careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Halifax was wrapped in a chilly grey fog
when the Wistmores drove in a couple of days
later. The monotonous tones of the bell buoy
in the harbor sounded continuously through the
city, and buildings and pavements dripped with
moisture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess we&rsquo;d better push right on,&rdquo; decided
Jack, &ldquo;and try to find before night a spot where
it is dry enough to camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>This</i> certainly isn&rsquo;t a very pleasant place
today,&rdquo; shivered Desir&eacute;, peering over his shoulder
at the gloomy streets.</p>
<p>After they got beyond the limits of the city,
the fog lifted somewhat so they could see the
road quite clearly, and even some distance on
either side. About ten miles outside of Halifax
they caught sight of something dark under a
tree ahead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<h2 id="c20"><br />CHAPTER XX
<br />GOOD SAMARITANS</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s a bear!&rdquo; exclaimed Ren&eacute;
hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s old ragbag,&rdquo; suggested Priscilla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; concluded Desir&eacute;, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be sick, or dead tired to sit there on
such a day,&rdquo; observed Jack.</p>
<p>Just as he spoke the words, the interested
watchers saw the man attempt to get up, and
fall heavily back upon the ground. Urging the
horses to greater speed, Jack soon brought the
wagon abreast of the unfortunate creature.
Face down, he lay perfectly motionless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be unconscious,&rdquo; said Jack, as they
all got out and stumbled up the bank upon
which the man was stretched.</p>
<p>Desir&eacute; held her breath as her brother was
rolling the figure carefully over. There was
something strangely familiar about that heavy
form. No mistake, it was their old enemy.</p>
<p>Brother and sister faced each other across
the quiet body.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p><a id="rfront" href="#front">&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s <i>him</i>!&rdquo; said Priscilla, in disgust.</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the man Jack fought with!&rdquo; squealed
Ren&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be badly hurt,&rdquo; said Jack; &ldquo;wonder
what we can do for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do! <i>Do!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed Priscilla; &ldquo;why, leave
him here and go on as fast as we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prissy!&rdquo; reproved Jack and Desir&eacute; with
one accord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t carry him to the wagon,&rdquo;
said Jack slowly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s so heavy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t want him in our nice wag&rsquo;n,&rdquo; declared
Ren&eacute; vehemently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can help you,&rdquo; offered Desir&eacute;, striving to
conquer her aversion to the man.</p>
<p>At that moment, the object of their concern
groaned and opened his eyes. Unseeing, at first,
they soon showed recognition of the faces above
his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble with you?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cracked up somewhere,&rdquo; was the sullen
response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did it happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fell over those stones in the fog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desir&eacute; turned to glance at the big pile of
sharp rocks nearby, and felt that a fall on those
could do almost any damage in an unexpected
encounter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where can we take you, or what can we do
for you?&rdquo; asked Jack briskly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s ridiculous! You can&rsquo;t stay here.
Could you walk as far as the wagon if we helped
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the aid of Jack and Desir&eacute;, one on
either side, he managed to get up. One or two
promptly stifled groans broke from him, and
he swayed precariously as he tried to stand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One foot&rsquo;s no good,&rdquo; he muttered, holding
it up and throwing all his weight on the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You two children go back and get into your
places in the wagon,&rdquo; ordered Jack. &ldquo;Push
your stools as close to the front seat as you
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reluctantly they obeyed, hanging over the
seat to watch the little procession. Slowly,
painfully, stopping often to rest, the injured
man was finally helped as far as the wagon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lean on the wheel a minute,&rdquo; directed Jack,
&ldquo;so my sister can get things fixed for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desir&eacute; opened the back doors, pushed the
tent as far to the side as it would go, and arranged
a couple of blankets on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is going to be the hardest bit,&rdquo; observed
Jack, when all was ready, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;ve
got to make it some way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Prissy and I can help him from the wagon,
if you can manage out here,&rdquo; suggested Desir&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, get in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two girls, Priscilla under protest,
grasped the man&rsquo;s shoulders and pulled, while
Jack eased his body and legs up from the
ground to the floor of the wagon. Half fainting
with pain and exertion, the patient was finally
settled on the blankets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going to take him?&rdquo; asked
Desir&eacute; softly, as Jack took his place and picked
up the reins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back to Halifax, where he can get a doctor.
I think his ribs as well as his foot are injured;
and Heaven only knows what else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were all very quiet as they re-covered
the ten miles to the city. Priscilla was sullen;
Ren&eacute; somewhat awed; Desir&eacute; compassionate,
and Jack thoughtful.</p>
<p>As they entered Halifax, Jack turned toward
their passenger and asked&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any special place here you want to be
taken?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wharf. Pal there who&rsquo;ll look after me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over the cobblestones, down the steep hill to
the docks they rattled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There he is. Tall fellow beside that pile of
crates,&rdquo; said the man who had been peering out
the crack between the doors, which had been
propped partly open to give him more air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>The fisherman turned at the sound of his
name, and Jack beckoned. With three or four
strides he was beside the wagon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wanted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the boy could reply, the injured man
called out&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in here, Bill. Had a smash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The newcomer, without a word, stepped to
the back of the wagon and stuck his head in.
After a short conversation, during which the
Wistmores stood beside the horses&rsquo; heads, he
slid the invalid part way out, put his powerful
arms under him, and picked him up like a child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much obliged to you for bringing him
back,&rdquo; he said awkwardly to Jack; then strode
away down the wharf; but before they were out
of earshot, the injured man called back over
the other one&rsquo;s shoulder&mdash;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve won!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of all strange experiences,&rdquo; exclaimed
Desir&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever did he mean?&rdquo; asked Priscilla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps that he wouldn&rsquo;t bother us any
more,&rdquo; replied Jack slowly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; he didn&rsquo;t give you any money, nor
nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; grumbled Ren&eacute;, as they started out
of Halifax for the second time that day. &ldquo;I
thought if anybody helped anyone else they
always gave &rsquo;em a&mdash;a&mdash;re&mdash;reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We <i>did</i> get a reward,&rdquo; said Desir&eacute; softly,
&ldquo;but not the kind you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s his wagon?&rdquo; demanded Priscilla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably he left it in Halifax,&rdquo; replied Jack
carelessly, as he wondered just what harm to
themselves the pile of stones might have
thwarted.</p>
<p class="tb">Progress on the way back toward Wolfville
was necessarily slow; for housewives all along
the route were preparing for the coming winter
when indoor occupations must replace the activities
of the warm months. Thread, wool, and
notions of all kinds were in great demand; for
the women folk must keep busy with more
feminine tasks, the hands that during the summer
had helped in gardens and farmyards, as
well as in picking blueberries to be shipped to
the States. Daily great trucks stop at the scattered
houses along certain sections rich in that
fruit to gather up supplies and take their loads
to the seaports where ships are waiting for
them. The average tourists en route from Nova
Scotia to the States little know, when they are
pacing the decks of the comfortable steamers,
that far below are crates and crates of berries
which will later be consumed by themselves at
home or in hotels.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>Several times Jack had to replenish his stock
as best he could from some town through which
they passed; and Desir&eacute; daily rejoiced at the
steadily increasing number of coins in their
little iron bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be rich yet!&rdquo; she exulted, shaking it
merrily as they drove away from Mount
Uniacke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry to destroy your hopes,&rdquo; said Jack,
half under his breath, so as not to be overheard
by the two children on the floor behind them,
playing a hotly contested game on the board
which Mrs. Auberge had given them. &ldquo;Had you
thought that we&rsquo;ll have to get some kind of
furniture for the Godet house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desir&eacute; looked at him wide-eyed with surprise
and dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Jack, how stupid I am! I never once
thought of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I, until today. I don&rsquo;t know what was
the matter with our brains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if stunned by the discovery, they drove
for some time in utter silence. In the protection
afforded by an upturned coat collar, and a
hat pulled far down over her curls, the girl let
fall a few tears. Jack, gazing fixedly ahead,
half buried in a coat at least two sizes too large
for him, was apparently oblivious of her distress.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>The day was grey and cold, with a brisk wind
whirling the golden leaves of the birches in all
directions, scattering the piles of brushwood
collected and left beside the road by some native
for firewood; rolling the pine cones merrily
along in the dust, and making the great firs and
balsams toss their branches ceaselessly. Its
chill warned of the near approach of snow and
ice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; began Desir&eacute; at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; untangling himself from his problems
with a start, and turning toward her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking about expenses for the
winter. Of course food will cost more, because
while we were on the road we had fish and
berries to help out; but in regard to the furniture,
we could get only what is absolutely necessary
for now, and add other pieces as we were
able to. We could doubtless pick up used
articles at low prices. Think how little we got
for our own things when we sold them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you and the children have got to be
comfortable, and warm,&rdquo; said Jack decidedly.
&ldquo;Camp life in the summer is all right; but too
much makeshift doesn&rsquo;t work in the winter
time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You must be comfortable, too,&rdquo; added
Desir&eacute; affectionately; &ldquo;but we <i>can</i> do with a
couple of mattresses on the floor, and a table
and four chairs for the present. Maybe we
could buy those from someone in Wolfville who
had more than they needed, and get them
cheaper that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must have a stove, dishes, and bedding,&rdquo;
added Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fireplace will do for heating; and I can
cook on the camp stove. We&rsquo;ve had enough
dishes and bedding for the summer; so a couple
of extra blankets will be all that we&rsquo;ll have to
buy in that line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want you to live like that,&rdquo; interrupted
her brother; &ldquo;we should have been
more comfortable if we&rsquo;d stayed in Sissiboo&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack! With you killing yourself trying
to pay off a big debt, and no prospects for years
and years! As it is, at least we&rsquo;re not in debt;
we&rsquo;ve had a lovely summer, in spite of a few
unpleasant spots; we&rsquo;re all healthy and together;
and we&rsquo;re going to live in the Godet
house this winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a cheerful little partner, Dissy,&rdquo;
said Jack, looking at her so admiringly that she
flushed with shame as she recalled the tears so
recently shed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we have money enough to get actual
necessities for the winter,&rdquo; he continued,
shamed by his sister&rsquo;s courage into taking a
more hopeful view of their situation. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m
hoping that I&rsquo;ll be able to pick up something
steady in Wolfville, or even Windsor, for the
winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the judge will be able to help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So don&rsquo;t get all blue and discouraged again,
Jack dear; we&rsquo;ll come out all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Late in the afternoon of another dull day,
they stopped in front of Judge Herbine&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess we got here just in time,&rdquo; observed
Jack, as he got out, pointing to a few stray
flakes of snow idling aimlessly through the air
as if they didn&rsquo;t care whether they stayed up
or floated down.</p>
<p>The judge himself opened the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So here you are at last!&rdquo; was his pleasant
greeting. &ldquo;Come in&mdash;have a cup of tea&mdash;before
you go&mdash;to look at your own place. Work&rsquo;s all
done.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>They were all cold and tired, and very glad
to accept his invitation. His housekeeper,
Madam Lovemore&mdash;for the judge had never
married&mdash;bustled around preparing a substantial
supper instead of &ldquo;tea.&rdquo; She was a sociable,
motherly creature, who loved to have
company at any time; but the thoughts of these
poor young things driving so many miles in the
cold, and going to live in that old house, so
touched her heart that no effort was too great,
and no food too fine to be placed before them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Favored&mdash;&rdquo; remarked the judge, as he
seated his guests at the dining room table.
&ldquo;Best plum preserves&mdash;my housekeeper must
like your looks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madam Lovemore, who was just taking her
accustomed place at the foot of the table, smiled
indulgently at him, as one might smile at an
outspoken child.</p>
<p>The meal lasted a long time; for the judge
wanted to hear all about their summer. Once
he excused himself and disappeared into the
kitchen where he held a lengthy conversation
with some unseen person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right away!&rdquo; they heard him say, as he
was about to re-enter the dining room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go over&mdash;with you,&rdquo; he said, when
Jack proposed their departure, saying that they
counted on staying in the house that night, living
camp fashion until they had a chance to
get the necessities. For an hour, Ren&eacute; had been
asleep on the horse-hair sofa, and Priscilla&rsquo;s
head kept nodding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re tired, poor dears,&rdquo; said Madam
Lovemore compassionately, as she helped
Desir&eacute; put their wraps on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>When they went outside, they discovered that
the world had completely changed its appearance.
A thin layer of snow made the roads look
like strips of white cloth; each dried weed, seed
pod, and knot of grass had a spotless cap; and
the outstretched arms of the firs held their light
burden so tenderly that not a flake was shaken
off.</p>
<p>The judge was to drive over in the Ford,
Madam Lovemore holding the still sleeping
Ren&eacute; in her lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be awful mad tomorrow,&rdquo; volunteered
Priscilla, who was now fully awake, &ldquo;when he
hears that he&rsquo;s been riding in an automobile
and didn&rsquo;t know anything about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The judge laughed, a sudden explosion, over
almost before it began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case&mdash;you&rsquo;d better come in here too;
so you can tell him&mdash;what it felt like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little girl&rsquo;s wistful look and tone had not
been unnoticed by the judge; and though they
were somewhat crowded, both he and his housekeeper
gladly put up with the slight discomfort
of an additional passenger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prissy is thrilled to death,&rdquo; said Desir&eacute; to
Jack, as they followed the Ford with as much
speed as the tired horses were able to make.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I wish you could have had a ride,
too. You&rsquo;ve always wanted one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, some day I shall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The headlights of the judge&rsquo;s car, which had
just turned off the main road into the lane leading
to the Godet house, revealed the fact that
all underbrush had been cleared away, and the
road filled in. So occupied were they with the
unexpected improvement, that not until they
had stopped in front of the cabin did they
notice that it was lighted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<h2 id="c21"><br />CHAPTER XXI
<br />A SURPRISE</h2>
<p>The judge, with Ren&eacute; in his arms, ushered
them inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome&mdash;to Wolfville!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;and to
the old Godet house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack and Desir&eacute; stood quite speechless, and
even the generally talkative Priscilla could find
no words. They could only look while the judge
and his housekeeper watched them smilingly,
though very close to tears themselves.</p>
<p>Ren&eacute; broke the spell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;o&mdash;o!&rdquo; he wailed, digging his fists into
his eyes, still half asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter&mdash;young fellow?&rdquo; demanded
the judge, who still held him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t finish my piece of cake!&rdquo; wailed
the child. He had dozed off at the table, before
finishing his supper.</p>
<p>They all laughed, while Madam Lovemore
consoled Ren&eacute; by promising him another piece
the next day. Then the young Wistmores inspected
their home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>Partitions separated the cabin into three
rooms: a large one, across one end, which was
to do duty as a general living room, with a place
for cooking at one end; and two small ones as
sleeping quarters. The partitions and floors were
painted a soft blue, which was relieved by the
dark logs of the side walls and the beamed roof.
Rag rugs lay upon the floor, a table occupied
the centre of the living room, and around it
were four ladder-back chairs. Beside the stone
fireplace was a low wooden rocker and a high-backed
upholstered one. Each bedroom had a
fully furnished double wooden bed, and a wash
stand. There was a bright fire in the fireplace;
simple muslin curtains were hung at the windows;
and a few pots of geraniums on a small
stand added to the homelikeness of the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;the furniture&mdash;&rdquo; began Desir&eacute;, when
she was able to put her thoughts into words.
Jack was still too dazed to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gifts from the people of Wolfville to the
children of the ancient Acadians,&rdquo; replied the
judge pompously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can never repay them,&rdquo; faltered Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t want you to. They were glad&mdash;to do
it. Liked idea&mdash;descendants to occupy old
house&mdash;deserted for so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a welcome I never dreamed of,&rdquo; murmured
Desir&eacute;. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why people are so
kind to us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>The judge and his good housekeeper exchanged
smiles at her naive remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you want them to be?&rdquo; demanded
Priscilla in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; answered her sister, attempting
unsuccessfully to draw the child to her side;
but Priscilla was too bent on inspecting article
by article in her new home to have any time
for cuddling just then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you folks&mdash;had better&mdash;get to bed,&rdquo;
said the judge, preparing for departure.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had a hard day&mdash;lots of excitement.
I&rsquo;ll lead the team back with me. Will they follow&mdash;the
Ford&mdash;do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I imagine so,&rdquo; replied Jack. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re very
gentle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He followed the judge outside to help him
with the horses, while Madam Lovemore bade
an affectionate goodnight to her new friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just run over any time anything bothers
you, my dear,&rdquo; she said to Desir&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;N&rsquo; not no other time?&rdquo; asked Ren&eacute;, fearful
of such an agreement working to his disadvantage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whenever you like&mdash;&rdquo; began the housekeeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell him that,&rdquo; advised Desir&eacute;, &ldquo;or
you may see him oftener than you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>Meanwhile Jack was saying to the judge, &ldquo;Of
course I know that you are really the one to be
thanked for all that,&rdquo; waving his arm at the
cozy, lighted cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; asserted the man stoutly. &ldquo;The
neighbors all helped. Liked it. Lots of fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet they never would have known about us,
or our needs, if you had not told them, and
made suggestions. I just can&rsquo;t express my very
deep gratitude, especially on account of my
little sisters. Ren&eacute; can rough it, but I hate to
have the girls deprived of ordinary comforts.
Sometimes I wonder if I have done the right
thing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One always wonders that&mdash;no matter what
one does. Go in, boy,&mdash;and send my housekeeper
out. Want to get home.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Housekeeping in the new home was a delight
and a novelty, after the many weeks of camp
life; and the Wistmores were very happy. Jack
took Priscilla into Wolfville the second day
after they arrived, and made arrangements for
her to attend school, much to her chagrin, for
she had hoped for a longer holiday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sense in her running about for days, and
missing something which will cause trouble for
her later,&rdquo; Jack had said, when discussing the
matter with Desir&eacute;. &ldquo;While it is still pleasant,
she can walk back and forth morning and afternoon,
and carry her lunch. In winter, we&rsquo;ll try
to make some different arrangements.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>After settling Priscilla, Jack consulted the
judge about getting work for himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See what I can do,&rdquo; he promised; and while
he was waiting, Jack helped Desir&eacute; with the
lessons she was trying to do by herself.</p>
<p>The snow which had greeted them on their
arrival disappeared almost immediately, and
the beautiful days of Indian summer hovered
over the valley of the Gaspereau. Jack and
Desir&eacute;, sometimes accompanied by Ren&eacute;, but
oftener leaving him with his staunch admirer,
Madam Lovemore, spent many hours rambling
around the country after their work was done.
It was a treat to both; for though they had
much in common, they seldom had opportunities
for private companionship, due to the constant
demands of the younger members of the family.</p>
<p>After a week of idling, Jack made some trips
through the nearby country with the wagon, but
the day schedules were soon exhausted; and he
began to be anxious about a different job. Some
of the nearer neighbors began to drop in occasionally;
so Desir&eacute; could not be his constant
companion, and he grew restless.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The people within a day&rsquo;s drive are too
near Wolfville for this to be a very good place
for a store like ours,&rdquo; he told Desir&eacute; when he
returned one afternoon after a rather profitless
day. &ldquo;One does not sell enough to pay for expenses.
So I guess we&rsquo;ll decide to put up the
wagon and team for the winter. In the spring,
as soon as the roads permit, I&rsquo;ll have to take it
back to old Simon at Yarmouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you mean <i>we&rsquo;ll</i> take it back, dear?&rdquo;
asked Desir&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps; we&rsquo;ll see when the time comes. I
hope the judge will be able to find a job for me
pretty soon; my own efforts are fruitless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry; if we have to use up all of our
little nest egg, we&rsquo;ll do it; that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desir&eacute; spoke bravely, but she felt sad to see
Jack&rsquo;s prospects of continuing his education retreat
so far into the background as almost to
disappear. The succeeding days were anxious
ones. Jack roamed about, restless and worried,
not having enough with which to occupy himself;
for the weather had changed, and outdoor
rambles were over for that year.</p>
<p>One afternoon a heavy rain began to fall, and
it looked as if it meant to continue indefinitely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Prissy will get soaked,&rdquo; said Desir&eacute;,
gazing out of the window for the fifth time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go after her,&rdquo; offered Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what good would it do for you to get
soaked, too?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>&ldquo;None, I suppose. The poor kid ought to
have a raincoat and an umbrella,&rdquo; he muttered,
half to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking about clothes, Jack, and
it seems to me that we&rsquo;ll have to draw some of
what we got for the farm&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s in the bank at Yarmouth,&rdquo; objected
Jack quickly, &ldquo;and you know we said it
shouldn&rsquo;t be touched except for sickness or
other emergencies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, but this is an emergency; isn&rsquo;t it?
If we don&rsquo;t buy a few necessary articles of
clothing, we&rsquo;ll run the risk of sickness, and that
would be far more expensive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, of course. Make out a list of
what we need, and then we&rsquo;ll count the probable
cost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do it together,&rdquo; said Desir&eacute;, getting
pencil and paper, and sitting down at the table
beside her brother.</p>
<p>They were so engrossed in their problem that
they both jumped violently when there was a
quick knock, and the judge stepped into the
room, closely followed by Priscilla. Ren&eacute;, who
had been amusing himself in the corner with
some toys which had been part of the &ldquo;furnishings&rdquo;
of the cabin, darted across the room to
fling himself upon the caller.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is a&mdash;terrible day!&rdquo; exclaimed the
judge. &ldquo;Thought the girl might&mdash;be drowned if&mdash;she
tried to&mdash;walk home. So I hitched up the
old Ford&mdash;and went after her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desir&eacute; began to express her gratitude, but
he brushed aside her attempts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing to it&mdash;wanted to see this boy&mdash;anyhow,&rdquo;
taking the chair Jack offered him, and
glancing up at the tall, broad-shouldered fellow
with a smile which, as Priscilla said, made his
face &ldquo;all crinkled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ve got&mdash;a job for you,&rdquo; he continued.
&ldquo;Know old man Beaumont?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack shook his head gravely, though his heart
rejoiced at the prospect of finding employment
at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been postman around here&mdash;for&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t know how many years. Too old now&mdash;but
won&rsquo;t give up; been trying to fix things&mdash;so
he&rsquo;d have a helper. Orders came couple of
weeks ago&mdash;good job for you&mdash;if you want it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Want</i> it!&rdquo; repeated Jack. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t possibly
imagine how much I want it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Government furnishes a little wagon&mdash;you&rsquo;ll
use one of your own horses&mdash;that is until snow
gets too deep. Then you&rsquo;ll have to go on&mdash;on
snowshoes. Have to go to town&mdash;to get your
orders&mdash;better go now in my Ford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, in an excited bustle, Jack got ready and
departed with the judge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry&mdash;about his getting wet,&rdquo; the
judge leaned far out of the car to call to Desir&eacute;,
who was standing in the doorway, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring
him&mdash;back again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was supper time before they returned, and
the rain had subsided for a time; but the judge
refused to come in although Desir&eacute; ran out to
the car and urged him to stay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t thank you enough,&rdquo; she added, leaning
over the door after he had started the
engine, &ldquo;for getting Jack the job. He was so
restless and worried, and <i>almost</i> unhappy; and
when Jack&rsquo;s upset, well&mdash;it just about kills me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The judge&rsquo;s keen eyes softened, and he patted
her hand kindly, saying, &ldquo;Run in, child&mdash;you&rsquo;ll
catch cold. Hear all Jack has to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drove rapidly down the lane, and Desir&eacute;
returned to her family. They spent a happy
evening around the fire, making plans for the
future. Now there would be no need of drawing
on the previous funds for clothing!</p>
<p>The next day the sun came out, and as soon
as breakfast was over the whole family started
out for Wolfville, picking their way carefully
around the big puddles. They left Priscilla at
school, and then went on to Judge Herbine&rsquo;s to
clear out the wagon preparatory to putting it
up for the winter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going to put all that?&rdquo; asked
Madam Lovemore, coming out in the midst of
their labors, to look at all the stock spread on
papers on the barn floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of it we&rsquo;ll use ourselves, and the rest
store until spring,&rdquo; answered Desir&eacute;, who was
busy sorting goods that would keep from those
which would not, while Jack, with pencil and
paper, was taking inventory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s lots of room in the attic. Just take
what you want to save up there. No use carting
it down to your house, where you need all the
space you have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The judge had ambled in while she was talking,
and strolled around, peering at first one
pile and then another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a day&rsquo;s job here,&rdquo; he observed.
&ldquo;When you hear the bell&mdash;come in to dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By night the task was finished, and the wagon
empty. The judge presented Jack with a shovel
and an axe, saying, &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t travel without these
in these parts in the winter time. You&rsquo;ll want
them&mdash;in the mail wagon. They&rsquo;re going to send
it down&mdash;in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desir&eacute; looked at him in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why will he need a shovel and an axe?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caught in storms sometimes&mdash;have to dig
your way out&mdash;trees fall in high winds&mdash;only
way is to chop your way through.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>Throughout supper, to which the judge insisted
upon their staying also, Desir&eacute; was very
quiet; and on the way home she took little part
in the children&rsquo;s chatter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Dissy?&rdquo; inquired Jack,
after the younger ones were in bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack! I was so very glad when you got
the appointment; and now I&rsquo;m so afraid for
you,&rdquo; she whispered, dropping her head on his
broad shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; he asked in surprise, slipping
his arm around her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because of the storms&mdash;the falling trees,&rdquo;
she choked. &ldquo;I never thought of that part of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m strong and well, dear; and the
work won&rsquo;t hurt me. And I promise you that
I&rsquo;ll be very careful, and take no foolish chances.
I don&rsquo;t like to think of you sitting at home,
nervous and unhappy, all the time I&rsquo;m away.
That would make the work much harder. So
you&rsquo;ll try to be brave, and not worry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desir&eacute; made a desperate effort to put aside
her fears, and promised to do as Jack wished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<h2 id="c22"><br />CHAPTER XXII
<br />CAUGHT BY STORM</h2>
<p>Jack had seen the storm approaching as he
was driving along a lonely road above a valley
in the late afternoon, but it would have been
about as far to turn back to the nearest shelter
as it would to go on as fast as he could to the
next. Urging the horses to do their best (for
during the severe weather he was using the
team), he drew up the robe, turned down the
sides of his cap, and fastened up his coat collar.
The snow came down faster and faster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good thing there&rsquo;s no wind,&rdquo; he muttered;
but even as he spoke a spiteful gust snatched
up an armful of snow, and whirled it into his
face. The horses did their best, but the road
seemed endless; nothing could be seen except
limitless stretches of white country, and trees
whose branches sagged under their heavy
loads.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>There was a sudden crash, and right across
his way dropped a huge limb of a birch tree,
stretching from one side of the road to the
other. The horses stopped, snorting with fright,
and when Jack had quieted them, he reached
into the back of the wagon for the axe, and got
out to clear a pathway. He dared not try to
drive around it; for he could not tell, on account
of the snow, just where the ground began to
slope sharply away toward the valley; and he
wasn&rsquo;t really anxious for a roll down those
hills.</p>
<p>Chopping the way through was a hard task
for one, and Jack had to stop very often to rest;
by the time he finished, it was dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now we&rsquo;re going on,&rdquo; he said
cheerily, giving a pat to either horse as he
passed their heads after dragging out the cut
section of the tree. The patient animals had
stood quietly, heads dropped, bodies relaxed,
while he worked. He had thrown blankets across
them, and the rest had given them a chance to
get their wind again. So they threw themselves
gallantly forward to their task, and soon pulled
the wagon down into the valley.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>Here the road was not so good; for the snow
had blown down the sides of the hills and
settled in drifts, some small and fairly passable,
others most difficult to plough through.
Several times Jack had to get out and shovel
before the horses were able to get the wagon
any farther on its way. The lanterns on the
wagon gave a fair light, with the help of the
whiteness all about them, but the road became
increasingly difficult to follow; and at last Jack
had to admit to himself that he was lost. He
had no idea which way to turn; but it was impossible
to stand still for the night&mdash;they would
be buried before morning if the snow kept on,
and the horses would perish. Recalling various
stories of the intelligence, or instinct, of animals
under like circumstances, he decided to
give the horses a loose rein and trust to Providence.
The faithful beasts plodded on and on,
while Jack strained his eyes through the
whirling snowflakes, searching for signs of
habitation.</p>
<p>Some time during the night he saw a dim outline
in front of him, and the horses stopped.
With an unspoken prayer of gratitude, he
dropped down from the seat, stiffly walked a
few steps to the house, and knocked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<h2 id="c23"><br />CHAPTER XXIII
<br />SHELTER</h2>
<p>After an interval, a light appeared; the
door opened a crack, and a gruff voice
demanded what was wanted. Jack, in a few
words, explained his presence and the man immediately
threw wide the door, bidding him
enter and make himself at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my team&mdash;&rdquo; began Jack.</p>
<p>The man cut him short. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look after it.
Go in and go to bed. The missus will show you
where.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A big dim room, with one flickering lamp; a
woman wrapped in a shawl, standing in a doorway
opening into another room; several
figures, each rolled in a blanket and lying near
the fireplace&mdash;such a sight greeted Jack as he
entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a blanket,&rdquo; said the woman. &ldquo;You
can lie wherever you like in this room.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>She disappeared at once, and the boy spread
the blanket on the floor a little beyond the other
dark, motionless figures. He rolled himself in
the blanket, and, using the mail bag for a pillow,
tried to sleep. Being exhausted, in spite of
the hard bed he dropped off almost as soon as
the man came in from caring for the team.</p>
<p>In the morning he felt stiff and sore, and his
head ached, due to sleeping on the floor, he supposed.
His host and hostess greeted him as
casually as if he had been dropping in there
every night, and offered him breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s De Vigne,&rdquo; said the man, as
they sat down to the table.</p>
<p>The three dark figures of last night still lay
rolled up beside the hearth, and Jack kept looking
at them as he gave his host a brief account
of his adventures. Finally, curiosity getting the
better of him, he ventured, &ldquo;Those fellows
sick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered De Vigne, glancing carelessly
at them. &ldquo;Flu, I guess. One of them is
our hired man. The other fellows dropped in
here last night a few hours ahead of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack was a brave boy, with no foolish dread
of illness; but the flu! The disease which had
deprived them of their father, of that he was
afraid; not so much on his own account, but
because of Desir&eacute;. Poor girl, she must be half
frantic by now. If he&rsquo;d only had some way of
getting word to her. He must lose no time in
starting out again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>Mr. De Vigne gave him the necessary directions
for getting back on his route again, and
an hour later he was delivering the letters
which had taken him to that lonely section.
Then he headed for home.</p>
<p>The sun came out and the snowy fields became
dazzling. If only his head wouldn&rsquo;t ache
so hard, and his stomach feel so queer. Probably
when he got some of Desir&eacute;&rsquo;s good cooking,
he&rsquo;d be all right. Yesterday he hadn&rsquo;t eaten
much, and he had been able to swallow very
little of the breakfast provided this morning by
the De Vignes. Encouraging himself in every
way he could, he managed to drive all the way
back; and in the middle of the afternoon, put
the team in its place. As he was leaving the
barn, he met the judge who had hurried out as
soon as he caught sight of the open door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove, boy!&rdquo; he began; then stopped.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sick! Come right in and go to bed.
We&rsquo;ll take care of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Desir&eacute;,&rdquo; faltered Jack, swaying a little in
the judge&rsquo;s grasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get her&mdash;Jonas! Come here and help
me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>With the aid of the hired man, the judge soon
had Jack in bed in the room next to his own,
and had sent for the doctor. Madam Lovemore
was rushing around, heating bottles, and preparing
broth. The trusty Ford never made such
good time as it did going down to the cabin and
back. The snow flew in all directions as the
judge forced the machine through it. Desir&eacute;,
worn and terrified by her night of fruitless
watching, almost fainted when the judge appeared
and told her his story. Jack&rsquo;s needs,
however, forced her to make a desperate effort
to be calm. In a very short time the judge
deposited her and the two children on his own
doorstep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve plenty of room,&rdquo; he decreed, &ldquo;and
you must all stay here until the boy&rsquo;s well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s asleep now, my dear,&rdquo; was Madam
Lovemore&rsquo;s greeting as she kissed Desir&eacute; in the
hall. &ldquo;The doctor&rsquo;s been here; and while he&rsquo;s
not positive, yet he thinks it&rsquo;s just a heavy
cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the hours of waiting, the anxiety, the
shock, resulted in one wild burst of tears when
Desir&eacute; peered in at Jack, sleeping heavily, his
face red, his lips drawn in tense lines. Madam
Lovemore led her hastily into a room on the
opposite side of the hall, and closed the door.
Sitting down in a big rocker, she drew the girl
into her lap as if she had been Ren&eacute;, and let her
cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;sorry&mdash;&rdquo; gasped Desir&eacute; presently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only natural, you poor little girl. Have
your cry out, and you&rsquo;ll feel lots better. Then
we&rsquo;ll make some plans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack slept most of the day, waking once to
smile feebly at Desir&eacute; who was bending over
him. She could not trust herself to speak, and
only kissed him tenderly.</p>
<p>Under the care of good Dr. Caronne, and with
the help of the delicious, nourishing foods prepared
by Madam Lovemore, and the combined
nursing of the entire household, Jack escaped
the flu. After a couple of days he was able to
get up, and a week later the Wistmores returned
to their own home; and Jack went back
to work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can never, never hope to repay what
they have done for us,&rdquo; said Jack gravely, when
they were talking of the kindness of their host
and hostess that night. &ldquo;You children must
remember that, and do everything you can for
them, every little thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; announced Ren&eacute; solemnly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
goin&rsquo; to marry Mad&rsquo;m Lovemore when I grow
up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;that would be a
wonderful way to repay her.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">During the rest of the winter Jack used
snowshoes for delivering the mail, and Desir&eacute;
was so fascinated by them that she learned to
use her brother&rsquo;s when he did not need them.
One day when he came from Windsor he
brought her a pair, and suggested that whenever
he went on short trips, she accompany him.
She was delighted, and quite often after that
she left Ren&eacute; at the judge&rsquo;s, and went skimming
over the snow with her beloved brother,
dearer now than ever after the fear of losing
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so mild out that I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised
if we had rain,&rdquo; announced Jack, when
he came in from his day&rsquo;s work one night late
in the winter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rain!&rdquo; exclaimed Priscilla. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s still
winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, Jack proved to be a good weather
prophet; for when they woke up the following
morning, rain was falling steadily, and the
snow looked soft and dirty. That was the beginning
of the break-up of winter. Each day the
sun rose higher and its rays became warmer;
and each day more of the snow melted, softening
the ground and filling streams, large and
small, to the very brim.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>The winds were softer and warmer; the birds
returned and began looking for home sites; and
the air was alive with their calls. From the new
green of the marshes came the continuous
croaking of frogs. Then the first wild flowers
slipped quietly into bloom; the fruit trees
pushed out bud after bud until they were
covered with fragrant blossoms. Nova Scotia
had come to active life again after the hard
winter.</p>
<p>The day Priscilla brought in a cluster of
arbutus, there was a general rejoicing. The
delicate pink blossom is greatly prized by the
people of Nova Scotia, and has been made the
national flower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The darlings!&rdquo; cried Desir&eacute;, holding the
tiny flowers close to her nose in order to inhale
their dainty fragrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up in the woods of Prince Edward Island
the Indians will be very busy now that the Mayflower&mdash;for
that is the other name for arbutus&mdash;has
come,&rdquo; observed Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Priscilla, putting her bouquet
carefully in water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as the flowers appear, the young
Indian braves search carefully for the finest
specimens they can find to throw at the woman
they want to marry. It is one of their regular
customs; so you can imagine how excited the
maidens are at this time of the year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pretty custom,&rdquo; said Desir&eacute;; but
the practical, unromantic Priscilla thought it
very funny, and so expressed herself as she
placed the vase in the center of the table.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And where are the Indians?&rdquo; demanded
Ren&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nowhere near here; so don&rsquo;t go looking for
them,&rdquo; ordered his brother.</p>
<p>Ren&eacute; looked very serious for a moment, and
said that he wouldn&rsquo;t. Apparently he had some
none too pleasant recollections of one escapade
in following Indians.</p>
<p>The apple orchards around Wolfville had begun
to drop their sweet pink and white petals,
and the countryside was streaked here and
everywhere with the deep blue of the iris, the
fleur-de-lys of France, when Jack commented
to Desir&eacute; one night that they&rsquo;d better take old
Simon&rsquo;s wagon back to him.</p>
<p>She laughed. &ldquo;You <i>did</i> say <i>we</i> this time.
When do you want to start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you manage it by Monday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Friday. Why, yes, I could. What
will you do about your job while you&rsquo;re gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It goes back to its regular owner,&rdquo; replied
Jack, trying to speak lightly; adding, as Desir&eacute;
looked puzzled, &ldquo;The old man can manage well
enough in pleasant weather. I was only a
helper for the winter months, you know. When
we come back for the summer, if we decide to
stay here, I&rsquo;ll have to look for something else.
I can probably get something either here or at
Windsor. We&rsquo;ll talk it over on the road.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we take the children, or leave them
with Madam Lovemore? When I mentioned one
day our having to go to Yarmouth, she offered
to keep them if we wished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would seem too much like imposing,&rdquo;
objected Jack; &ldquo;she has been so very kind to
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; admitted Desir&eacute;; &ldquo;and yet I know
she&rsquo;s very willing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing,&rdquo; said Jack thoughtfully, &ldquo;I hate
to have Priscilla miss so many days of school,
and she would have to if we took her. How
would it do if we left her and took Ren&eacute;? Do
you think that would be a good idea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I think that would be fine, and it
would even things up better. Prissy can be
quite a help to Madam Lovemore, while Ren&eacute;
always bears watching. I suppose Prissy won&rsquo;t
like being left behind, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably not; and it will seem queer to
leave her. It will be the first time we&rsquo;ve been
separated since&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Desir&eacute; hurriedly, as Jack&rsquo;s voice
faltered; &ldquo;but we know that she will be well
cared for; and after we&rsquo;re once gone, she&rsquo;ll
soon get used to the new conditions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was settled, and although at first Priscilla
was inclined to feel injured, by the time
Monday came she was quite resigned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have lots of automobile rides, I suppose,&rdquo;
they overheard her saying importantly
to Ren&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll see old Simon again!&rdquo; boasted the
small boy; &ldquo;and go on a big boat&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;everything,&rdquo;
determined not to be outdone.</p>
<p>The older ones smiled as they went about
closing up the cabin. They walked as far as the
judge&rsquo;s; and although there was no one to see
her, Priscilla felt very important carrying the
suitcase which held her wardrobe. There was
no chance for prolonged farewells; for when
they reached their destination it was so nearly
time for school that Priscilla could give them
only a hasty hug and kiss apiece, before dashing
down a side road toward the schoolhouse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<h2 id="c24"><br />CHAPTER XXIV
<br />BACK TO YARMOUTH</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I meant to give her a few directions,&rdquo;
said Jack, picking up the suitcase she had
dropped at his feet, and gazing after the child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had a long talk last night after I went
to bed,&rdquo; replied Desir&eacute;; &ldquo;and I think she will
do just as we should like to have her. Prissy
is growing up a bit, Jack; she really tried to be
brave and generous about being left behind on
this trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they were ready to start, the judge and
his housekeeper stood on the steps to bid them
goodbye and good luck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t feel that you&rsquo;ve got to hurry back,&rdquo;
called Judge Herbine as the horses started.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take good care of the little girl, and
keep an eye on the cabin. Won&rsquo;t hurt you to
have a bit of a vacation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve gotten awfully fond of him; haven&rsquo;t
you, Jack?&rdquo; asked Desir&eacute;, looking back to wave
her hand at the judge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; he&rsquo;s a fine old fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>After they had been riding an hour or two,
Ren&eacute; demanded suddenly&mdash;&ldquo;When are we goin&rsquo;
to sell somethin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not going to,&rdquo; replied Jack briefly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; explained Desir&eacute;, &ldquo;if we stopped
every little while it would take too long to get
to Yarmouth; and Jack is in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really should have started before, I suppose,&rdquo;
remarked her brother; &ldquo;but I was
afraid the roads might be in poor condition.
Besides, it would have been too cool and damp
for camping, and I didn&rsquo;t want to give up the
job until I had to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;n me goin&rsquo; to sleep in the tent again?&rdquo;
inquired Ren&eacute;, poking the roll of canvas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad. I like tents better&rsquo;n houses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t in the winter,&rdquo; laughed
Desir&eacute;. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll miss Prissy. The wagon will seem
big for me after last year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we goin&rsquo; to give Simon the horses and
wagon?&rdquo; inquired Ren&eacute; in alarm, a new thought
suddenly occurring to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to give them <i>back</i> to him,&rdquo;
said Jack. &ldquo;They belong to him, you know. He
only lent them to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh! But I never can walk all the way
back again,&rdquo; he wailed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stop crying,&rdquo; ordered Jack; &ldquo;and you
won&rsquo;t have to walk all the way back. You cry
altogether too much. You&rsquo;re getting to be too
big a boy to act like a baby; you must learn
to act like a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going back on the train, darling,&rdquo;
said Desir&eacute; softly. Somehow she liked to think
of Ren&eacute; as a baby rather than as a &ldquo;man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On a train!&rdquo; squealed Ren&eacute;. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awful
glad I came.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">The weather stayed pleasant, and no accidents
of any kind befell the Wistmores on their
journey to Yarmouth; it seemed strangely uneventful
by contrast with the trip up the preceding
summer. They had decided that it was
best to forego the pleasure of calling on old
friends, even those in Sissiboo, and get on to
Yarmouth just as quickly as possible. It was
after dark when they passed their old home.
Ren&eacute; was asleep, and Jack and Desir&eacute; gazed at
the familiar outlines in silence. The windows
showed squares of yellow light, and a few
sparks floated out of the chimney. Those were
the only signs of life about the place; in fact
the whole town was deserted. All the people
seemed to have withdrawn to their homes for
the night.</p>
<p class="tb">Shortly before noon one warm day they
stopped in front of Mrs. Chaisson&rsquo;s house in
Yarmouth. Before they had a chance to get out,
old Simon himself came hurrying out from the
back yard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it!&rdquo; he exclaimed triumphantly,
throwing open the gate. &ldquo;As soon as ever I
heard hoofs on the street, I says to myself,
&lsquo;There&rsquo;s Dolly and Dapple.&rsquo; How are ye all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped to speak affectionately to the
horses, who responded in their own fashion to
his advances; and then he called his daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matty!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the Wistmores.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Chaisson hurried out and greeted them
warmly, inquiring for Priscilla whom she
missed at once.</p>
<p>After embraces and explanations, Mrs. Chaisson
invited them all to &ldquo;come right in to dinner,&rdquo;
adding that she must have felt they were
on the way, for she cooked more than usual.</p>
<p>After several days of camp fare, the meal
tasted delicious to the hungry travelers, and
they spent a long time at the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll stay here, of course, while you&rsquo;re in
town,&rdquo; said Mrs. Chaisson decidedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s most awfully kind of you,&rdquo; began
Jack, &ldquo;but it really seems too much&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! There were four of you last
time, and we had lots of fun. Didn&rsquo;t we,
Ren&eacute;? And now we&rsquo;ve got a dog for you to play
with. Run out in the back yard and make
friends with Rex.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child departed joyfully; old Simon and
Jack withdrew to the porch to talk over the
year&rsquo;s sales, and Desir&eacute; helped with the dinner
work.</p>
<p>That evening after Ren&eacute; had been put to bed&mdash;Mrs.
Chaisson had decreed the season too
early for sleeping on the porch, and had placed
a cot in one corner of old Simon&rsquo;s room for the
little boy&mdash;the rest of them gathered around the
air tight stove in the sitting room. The evenings
were likely to be cool, and even Rex crept in
to lie at their feet and enjoy the welcome heat
of a wood fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matty,&rdquo; began her father, &ldquo;I was tellin&rsquo; the
young feller,&rdquo; laying his hand on Jack&rsquo;s knee
as he spoke, &ldquo;he&rsquo;d better stay on here until
after the lobsters are in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good idea, if he doesn&rsquo;t need to hurry
back,&rdquo; agreed Mrs. Chaisson, picking up her
sewing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; went on the old man, turning to
Desir&eacute;, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s quite a bit of profit in lobsters,
and the boy says he has nothin&rsquo; in sight for the
present; so why not pick up a few dollars?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not know how to reply on the spur of
the moment, and looked at Jack for inspiration.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know a thing about the business,&rdquo;
said the boy slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! I can teach ye all ye need to know in
half a day,&rdquo; declared the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed. Father&rsquo;s a good hand at it, or
was before he got the rheumatism,&rdquo; said his
daughter, biting off her thread.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll tell ye just what I thought,&rdquo; said
Simon. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve an old hut down on the shore
toward Lower Woods Harbor way, and pots
and markers enough for you. Many of them
need mending, but I&rsquo;ll show you how to do
that; and I thought mebbe you&rsquo;d take the outfit,
if this girl don&rsquo;t mind roughing it a bit&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; began Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let her stay here,&rdquo; suggested Mrs. Chaisson.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m lonesome after you go on the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are very kind,&rdquo; said Desir&eacute; quickly,
&ldquo;but I really couldn&rsquo;t leave Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; began Jack again, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t
deprive you of the lobster catching, Simon. It
was bad enough taking your store for a year,
without&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Takin&rsquo; nothing!&rdquo; interrupted the old man
vehemently. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you keep my horses from
eating their heads off all year, and keep my
trade from goin&rsquo; to some one else fer good?
Besides, I can&rsquo;t catch lobsters any more. Doc
says that messin&rsquo; in the water&rsquo;s bad for my
rheumatiz. Goin&rsquo; to give up the hut after this
year anyway; so if you want to stay and take
it, you&rsquo;re more&rsquo;n welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>They discussed the matter all the evening,
until Simon got up to go to bed, and his
daughter withdrew to her room which Desir&eacute;
was to share. To Jack fell the big sofa in the
living room. He and Desir&eacute; sat on beside the
fire for a few minutes after they were left alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of it, Dissy? Shall I
take it or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly know what to say; but there&rsquo;s no
reason I can think of why you shouldn&rsquo;t, if it
looks good to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I have no other immediate prospects;
but it would be rough and lonesome for
you, I&rsquo;m afraid&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lonesome, with you around? As for being
rough, it will be fun to try a different way of
living for a few weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Secretly Desir&eacute; rather longed for the coziness
of the Godet house, but she thought Jack felt
he should make the most of every opportunity
for earning money, and she wanted to make
things as easy for him as possible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>The next morning, with a big basket of lunch
in the back of the wagon, they all drove down
to the hut, Ren&eacute; wild with excitement. An
hour&rsquo;s drive brought them to the bleak,
deserted coast. Nothing but sand, jagged rocks,
coarse grass, and scattered huts met their eyes.
They left the team just off the road beside a
clump of juniper, and crossed the sand to the
hut. When Simon unlocked the door, the interior
seemed to be a jumble of lumber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get all these pots out in a jiffy,&rdquo; he said,
picking up a couple of crate-like objects and
depositing them outside.</p>
<p>They all helped, and soon the pots were piled
up beside the hut.</p>
<p>The rooms were tiny, only two in number, a
bedroom and a general room; and the furniture
was scanty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t possibly live here, Dissy,&rdquo; whispered
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on and learn how to catch the beasts,
and I&rsquo;ll attend to the house,&rdquo; she replied with
forced cheeriness.</p>
<p>So Mrs. Chaisson and Desir&eacute; cleaned and set
in perfect order the tiny wooden building, while
Simon taught Jack how to make and repair
lobster pots. They look like oblong crates, and
are made of narrow strips of wood bent into a
semi-circle and nailed onto a board. A couple
of holes are left for the lobsters to crawl in,
and the whole is lined with coarse net, and
weighted with heavy stones.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>At noon they spread the lunch on a huge flat
boulder on the beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lots nicer than an old table,&rdquo; Ren&eacute; pronounced
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have no trouble in roughing it as far
as he&rsquo;s concerned,&rdquo; laughed Mrs. Chaisson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; he&rsquo;s usually satisfied with what he
has,&rdquo; replied Desir&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; contradicted the child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Renny,&rdquo; said Jack in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Dissy said I was satisfied, and I
ain&rsquo;t. I want a dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe when we go home you can have
one,&rdquo; said Jack, adding to Desir&eacute;, &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t
be a bad plan at all, if we stay in Wolfville.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ren&eacute;, as happy as if the desired pet were to
be forthcoming on the morrow, returned to his
play in the sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Simon, when all traces of lunch
had been cleared up, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll all paint markers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The long stakes with big wooden knobs on the
top were weather beaten, and their bands of
orange and green were dim. Each fisherman
has a different kind of marker, and sets one up
beside each pot after it is sunk beneath the
water. They serve two purposes: mark the
place where the pot is located, and notify other
fishermen of their ownership. It is a serious
matter for anyone to touch lobsters guarded by
the markers of another person. It is interesting
to note the numberless varieties of color
combinations, styles of banding, and shapes of
knobs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>It was a tired crowd of workers that returned
to Yarmouth that evening; for although everything
was ready in the hut for the new occupants,
Mrs. Chaisson insisted upon their going
back for &ldquo;one more really comfortable sleep&rdquo;
as she expressed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do we get back and forth from the
huts?&rdquo; inquired Desir&eacute;, the following morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take ye out,&rdquo; answered Simon, &ldquo;and
when you want to come in, you&rsquo;ll have to walk
until you meet somebody who&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; your way
and who will give you a lift.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Jack wrote to the judge, telling him of their
plans and probable delay; both he and Desir&eacute;
wrote short notes to Priscilla; and before noon
they were settled in their temporary home,
Desir&eacute; helping Jack get the lobster pots ready
to sink, while Ren&eacute; lay at full length in the sand
poking at a jellyfish. None of them saw a
figure walk along the road, stop, watch for a
while, then move silently across the grass and
along the sand until it stood directly back of
the workers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<h2 id="c25"><br />CHAPTER XXV
<br />LOBSTER POTS</h2>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing with those?&rdquo; demanded
a rough voice so suddenly that Desir&eacute;
dropped the marker she held, and gave a little
scream, while Ren&eacute; rolled over and lay with
his head on the unfortunate jellyfish. Jack,
the only cool person of the group, replied
quietly, &ldquo;Getting them ready to sink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You get yourself ready to go along with
me. These belong to Simon Denard, and you&rsquo;ve
no right to touch &rsquo;em. So come along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man laid a heavy hand on Jack&rsquo;s arm,
and attempted to jerk him off somewhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know they belong to Simon,&rdquo; replied
Jack. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re friends of his, and he has lent
us the place for a few weeks. We&rsquo;re going to
live here, my sister and I.&rdquo; Jack gazed calmly
into the dark, determined face and keen black
eyes confronting him.</p>
<p>Desir&eacute; was too frightened to utter a word,
and stood at her brother&rsquo;s other side, holding
fast to his coat. Ren&eacute; suddenly recovered his
voice and began to cry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hush your noise!&rdquo; ordered the man, without
turning his head; and so great was the
child&rsquo;s astonishment that he really <i>did</i> stop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need of getting excited about
this,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;You can easily prove that
I&rsquo;m telling the truth if you&rsquo;ll ask Mrs.
Chaisson, Simon&rsquo;s daughter, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no time to be running to Yarmouth;
and it&rsquo;s a likely story anyway,&rdquo; answered the
man shortly.</p>
<p>None of them saw Ren&eacute; get up and run toward
the road, where he saw a man passing
by; so when he now hurried across the sand as
fast as his short legs could move, dragging his
captive by the arm, they all looked up in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; cried the newcomer, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the
matter here, Marvine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young fellow claims old Simon lent him
the outfit. Did you ever hear&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he did,&rdquo; interrupted the other man
indifferently, his blue eyes roaming from one
face to another. &ldquo;Saw all these folks here yesterday
with the old man and his daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did, eh? Well, maybe it&rsquo;s as he says then,&rdquo;
letting go of Jack&rsquo;s arm as he spoke. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d
you happen to be stopping here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The kid dragged me off the road saying
someone was going to carry away his brother.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the man called Marvine, turning
to Jack and Desir&eacute;, &ldquo;sorry to have bothered
you. No harm meant. Was only looking out
for Simon&rsquo;s things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite all right,&rdquo; replied Jack. &ldquo;I suppose
you do have to be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two strangers strode out to the road
again without further farewell, and were soon
lost to sight. Desir&eacute; sank down on the sand
as if she could not stand another minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m most awfully sorry you were so frightened,
dear,&rdquo; said Jack, sitting down beside her
and taking her hand in his, while Ren&eacute; piled
on top of his brother, crying exultantly, &ldquo;I
saved you, Jack; didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desir&eacute; soon recovered her composure and
got up to continue her work; but although he
did not comment on the fact, Jack saw that her
hands were still a bit shaky. Presently he suggested&mdash;&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t
you better go in and start
supper, Dissy? Ren&eacute; can help me finish here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; agreed the small boy importantly.
&ldquo;I can help Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desir&eacute; went in, and the two boys sank the
pots and set the markers, Jack of course doing
most of the work, but Ren&eacute; fully convinced that
his brother could never have managed without
his aid.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There are some other pots right next to
where Simon told me to put ours,&rdquo; observed
Jack, as they were finishing supper.</p>
<p>Ren&eacute; was so sleepy that he had left the table
and curled himself up in an old rocker to take
a nap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I do hope that they don&rsquo;t belong to
either of those awful men who were here this
afternoon,&rdquo; said Desir&eacute; with a shudder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re rough, of course, but they weren&rsquo;t
really so bad, Desir&eacute;. They have to protect
their interests, and of course were looking after
Simon&rsquo;s. I hardly think, though, that either
of them is our next-door neighbor. The hut
beyond here looks deserted, but the pots and
markers are there all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desir&eacute; took the tiny bedroom, and the boys
had a couple of cots in the other room. Everybody
was tired out with the unaccustomed work
and excitement, and slept heavily until far later
than usual. Jack, who was the first to waken,
looked across at the other cot to see if Ren&eacute;
was still asleep, and was astonished to see that
the cot was empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now where is that rascal?&rdquo; he thought,
crossing the room to the outside door, which
was ajar.</p>
<p>He glanced out and saw his brother calmly
playing in the sand a short distance from the
hut.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go any farther away, Renny,&rdquo; he
called softly, hoping not to disturb Desir&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the child, vigorously slapping
the sand into shape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; called Desir&eacute;, who
had wakened instantly at the sound of his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all. Renny got up ahead of us
and went out to play in the sand. He&rsquo;s quite
all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what time is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d never guess. It&rsquo;s eight o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Jack, how dreadful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all; it&rsquo;s quite all right. There&rsquo;s
nothing to hurry us here. Take your time.
I&rsquo;ll set the coffee on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re certainly fashionable folk this morning,&rdquo;
laughed Desir&eacute; when, half an hour later,
the three sat down to breakfast. &ldquo;Renny, your
feet are all wet,&rdquo; as the child&rsquo;s foot touched
her under the table. &ldquo;Let me see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ren&eacute;,&rdquo; ordered Jack, &ldquo;turn and stick your
feet out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly, most reluctantly, the boy obeyed; and
Desir&eacute; exclaimed with dismay. He was wet to
the waist. Their backs had been turned when
he came in, and he had slid into his place at
the table with all possible haste.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get like that?&rdquo; asked Jack,
but Ren&eacute; only hung his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answer me, Renny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Went in the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But haven&rsquo;t I told you <i>never</i> to go into the
water alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to go back to bed,&rdquo; decreed his
brother sternly, getting up from the table. &ldquo;Sit
still,&rdquo; he directed Desir&eacute;. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll attend to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better put him in my room?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; replied Jack, leading
the reluctant youngster from the room.</p>
<p>After a short interval he returned to resume
his interrupted breakfast, saying as he sat
down, &ldquo;After we finish I&rsquo;ll take him something.
It will do him no harm to wait a while. He&rsquo;s
certainly always getting into difficulties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s quite a while now since he has done
anything really bad,&rdquo; objected Desir&eacute;; &ldquo;and
he loves the water so, it must be quite a temptation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, but his going in like this by himself
might result in serious consequences; and
I intend to keep him in bed most of the day.
But you don&rsquo;t need to stay in the house all the
time. He&rsquo;s perfectly safe here alone, and I&rsquo;m
sure he won&rsquo;t get up without permission. I
laid heavy penalties on such a procedure.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>At this point there was a sharp knock at the
door, and when Jack opened it, a short, grey-bearded
man stood before them. Not liking the
look in the stranger&rsquo;s eyes, Desir&eacute; crossed the
room and stood beside her brother. Were all
the people they were to meet on this venture
undesirable? How she wished they had never
heard of the lobster business!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<h2 id="c26"><br />CHAPTER XXVI
<br />HANDS OFF!</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; said Jack pleasantly, but
looking questioningly at their caller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a serious charge to make,&rdquo; answered
the newcomer, without returning the greeting.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been trying to steal my lobsters. You
know the penalty for that trick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I most certainly have not done any such
thing,&rdquo; said Jack decidedly, while Desir&eacute;
twisted her hands in dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use denying it; I can prove it. Mine
are right next to yours, and some of my markers
have been pulled up and yours put in. Come
out and see for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack and Desir&eacute; followed the man quickly
across the sand to the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See? Here are five of my markers hidden
under this old crate on your property, and
five of your markers replacing those near-shore
pots of mine. Facts don&rsquo;t lie if folks do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother never lies!&rdquo; cried Desir&eacute; angrily.
Jack had never heard her speak like that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy, Dissy,&rdquo; he said softly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly admit that it looks bad,&rdquo; he said
to the man; &ldquo;but since I know the rules governing
these things, I should hardly have been
fool enough to do such a thing even if I had
been so lacking in principle; and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack!&rdquo; interrupted Desir&eacute;. &ldquo;Ren&eacute;! Could
a small boy have done this?&rdquo; she asked, facing
their neighbor eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might; early in the morning, before the
tide came in so far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, go and get him and we&rsquo;ll see if he
knows anything about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Jack was gone, Desir&eacute; explained to the
man their presence in old Simon&rsquo;s hut, and
her reasons for suspecting that her younger
brother had been responsible for the morning&rsquo;s
difficulties. Soon Jack returned, and led Ren&eacute;
directly to the man, who regarded him gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell this man, Ren&eacute;,&rdquo; directed his brother,
&ldquo;just exactly what you did when you were out
here alone on the beach early this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pulled up dirty old markers and hid &rsquo;em,
and pushed down nice ones we painted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ren&eacute; was obviously rather proud of his
achievement, and quite puzzled as to the serious
manner of his elders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you do that?&rdquo; asked the man, the
suggestion of a twinkle appearing in his blue
eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wanted Jack&rsquo;s lobster bed to look nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But those weren&rsquo;t his; they were mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Everything&rsquo;s</i> Jack&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their neighbor smiled, and held out his hand
to Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mistake,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know what
a grasping partner you had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He means well, but makes trouble sometimes.
Take him back to bed; will you, Dissy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Desir&eacute; put the little boy in bed again,
and tried to impress upon him the seriousness
of his mistake, Jack and his neighbor worked
amiably side by side.</p>
<p>The days passed quickly, one very much like
all the others which had preceded it; and at
last they found themselves on the train, bound
for home, with a fair sum of money in return
for several weeks of hard work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<h2 id="c27"><br />CHAPTER XXVII
<br />JACK&rsquo;S JOBS</h2>
<p>The summer days which followed were delightful
ones. Priscilla reminded Jack of his
promise to help her make a garden; so he
worked hard, clearing the ground back of the
cabin, and spading up beds under her directions.
She planted very carefully the seeds
given her by Madam Lovemore, and waited impatiently
for the first bits of green to appear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess while I&rsquo;m at it, I&rsquo;ll make a vegetable
garden too,&rdquo; announced Jack, after he had
finished the flower beds. &ldquo;A bit late, perhaps,
but we&rsquo;ll get something out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good idea,&rdquo; approved Desir&eacute;. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She caught up the rake and followed him
to the end of the property.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love to work out-of-doors,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and
after you get a job I can attend to the vegetables
while Prissy takes care of her flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t got nuthin&rsquo; to take care of,&rdquo;
sighed Ren&eacute;, feeling that he had been left out
of all these new plans.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Should you like a garden, darling?&rdquo; asked
Desir&eacute;, her sympathy immediately aroused by
his mournful tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no old garden. Want a dog to take care
of; &rsquo;n&rsquo; Jack promised me one, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desir&eacute; glanced up at her older brother who
was leaning on his spade figuring out just
where he would begin to dig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did promise him, Jack, or practically
so,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No chance of being allowed to forget anything
in this family,&rdquo; he smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see what
I can do for you, Ren&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day Jack went up alone to see Judge
Herbine. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry if I don&rsquo;t show up for
dinner,&rdquo; he said to Desir&eacute; before leaving. &ldquo;The
judge told me yesterday that he had heard of
two or three places where I might get a job,
and to come up and see him today. I&rsquo;ll keep
going until I&rsquo;ve investigated all the possibilities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, dear; and the best of luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had had many talks on the drive to
Yarmouth, and on the beach in front of the hut,
as to the advisability of remaining in the Godet
house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s simply living from hand to month,&rdquo;
Jack had said gravely; &ldquo;but there seems to be
nothing else in sight just now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Even so, we&rsquo;re certainly some better off
than we should have been in Sissiboo,&rdquo; Desir&eacute;
said consolingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what would you do,&rdquo; suggested Jack,
&ldquo;if somebody came along and wanted the cabin
some day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them have it, if they could prove they
owned it; but Judge Herbine seems to think
such a thing most unlikely. He said, you know,
that they couldn&rsquo;t get a clear title when that
American wanted to buy it. But why, Jack,
does somebody want it now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not that I know of; but one can never
tell what might happen. The bus line will run
along the main road past our lane this summer,
I understand; and some tourist might take a
fancy to the little cabin and want to buy it.
I suppose if enough money were spent on a
search, it might be possible to establish the
title; or someone who wanted it badly enough
might be willing to take a chance. I don&rsquo;t mean
to worry you unduly, Desir&eacute;, but we mustn&rsquo;t
get so attached to the place that having to give
it up sometime will come as a great shock.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>Her brother&rsquo;s words came back to her mind
many times that day as she went about her
household tasks. Of course they mightn&rsquo;t want
to live right here always. Jack must finish college,
as they planned; but she wanted to go
through high school; and after that, the magical
trip to the States, where Jack might find his
life-work. How many times they had gone over
it all! At the rate money had come in so far,
however, it would take many years to realize
any of these day dreams, to say nothing of all
of them. It seemed, no matter how careful she
tried to be, to take <i>so</i> much money to feed and
clothe them; and if somebody <i>should</i> claim the
cabin&mdash;well, she&rsquo;d better not think about that
any more just now.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon, when the lane was getting
shadowy, the girls and Ren&eacute; were sitting
on the broad stone step watching for Jack. The
sound of an approaching automobile broke the
country stillness, and Judge Herbine&rsquo;s Ford
presently stopped. Jack got out, followed by
a big, awkward-looking brown dog. With one
wild shriek, Ren&eacute; dashed down the lane and
threw his arms around the animal&rsquo;s neck. The
judge waved to the girls, and drove away
laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a dog! I&rsquo;ve got a dog!&rdquo; chanted
Ren&eacute;, dragging the big beast toward the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s perfectly gentle, for all his size,&rdquo; said
Jack in reply to Desir&eacute;&rsquo;s questioning look.
&ldquo;But Ren&eacute;, you must be kind to the dog, and
never hurt him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where in the world did you get him?&rdquo; demanded
Priscilla, who did not like any dog very
well, and especially a big one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The judge found him somewhere off in the
country,&rdquo; replied Jack, sitting down on the step
which was much too low for his long legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is hardly a beauty,&rdquo; observed Desir&eacute;,
watching Ren&eacute; mauling his new friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but he&rsquo;s always been used to children,
and the judge thought that a good recommendation.
Of course he&rsquo;s awkward, and probably
mischievous; for he&rsquo;s not yet full grown&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Don&rsquo;t</i> tell me he will get bigger!&rdquo; groaned
Desir&eacute;. &ldquo;Where shall we ever put him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix a place; don&rsquo;t worry about that part
of it,&rdquo; Jack promised, getting up to go into
the cabin.</p>
<p>The evening was a riot of small boy and dog.
With much difficulty they were separated at
bedtime; for Ren&eacute; insisted upon his new pal
sleeping on the foot of the bed, and wept copiously
when the dog was banished. They said
<i>he</i> mustn&rsquo;t ever hurt the dog, he moaned, and
here they were hurting him by taking him
away!</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to be unruly over the dog,&rdquo;
said Jack, &ldquo;I shall take him right back, and
you will never have another.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jack will fix Rover up all nice somewhere,&rdquo;
promised Desir&eacute;, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll see him again
in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quiet was restored, and after she had gotten
Ren&eacute; to bed, Desir&eacute; went out behind the cabin
where Jack was preparing a place for the new
member of the family. He had turned on an
end the box which had held their belongings
while they were on the road, and placed a bit
of old carpet in the bottom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold the kennel!&rdquo; he said proudly, with
a wave of the hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But will he stay in it?&rdquo; asked Desir&eacute;, somewhat
doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not without being tied, for a few nights,&rdquo;
replied Jack, running a rope from the dog&rsquo;s
collar through a stout staple on the side of
the box. &ldquo;Then he&rsquo;ll be used to the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t told me anything yet about
your job prospects,&rdquo; said Desir&eacute; rather reproachfully,
as they walked around to the front
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could I, in all the noise and excitement?&rdquo;
laughed Jack. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s sit out here for
a while. Wait a minute; I&rsquo;ll get a couple of
chairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He brought out the rocker for his sister, and
a straight chair for himself, tilting it back
against the side of the house to make it more
comfortable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great night,&rdquo; he commented, with a
sigh of content. &ldquo;Just see that moon! Doesn&rsquo;t
it look as if it were stuck in the top of the
trees?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nights like this ought to make our gardens
grow fast,&rdquo; replied Desir&eacute;. &ldquo;Now what about
the job?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I have a temporary one; will last
about a week or two; and a promise of a steady
one for the rest of the summer. Isn&rsquo;t that
great?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly is. Where, and what doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know we heard that there was to be a
bus line through this part of the country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you can&rsquo;t drive a bus, Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly; but it seems that the company that
is to run it is sending men here from Boston
who, though they know how to run busses, know
nothing about the country. So I&rsquo;m to ride
around with them, show them the best roads,
and tell them local history until they&rsquo;ve learned
the ropes. Of course that won&rsquo;t take very long,
but it&rsquo;s fair pay while it lasts. They&rsquo;ll pick
me up at the end of the lane here every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Priscilla and Ren&eacute; will be desperately envious
of you, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely. Maybe before the season is
over I&rsquo;ll be able to take all of you on a little
trip, over part of the route at least.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That would be lovely, but don&rsquo;t mention
it before the children. I feel that if we have any
extra money it ought to be put away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re right; but I&rsquo;d like to be
able to give you a little pleasure sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, and I do have pleasure, Jack; and
we&rsquo;ll just look forward to more chance for such
things in the future. And about the other job?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim Rutland is going to open a kind of
lunch stand in one end of his general store; for
tourists, you know. He wants me to run it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why does Jim need anyone? I should
think he could attend to both himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has to be out of the store quite a lot.
He sells everything from chickens to farm machinery,
has a gas station, and I don&rsquo;t know
what else. He thought his son would stay home
and help him out this summer, as he did last;
but he had a chance to go to the States, and
he&rsquo;s going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it much of a job, Jack?&rdquo; asked Desir&eacute;,
rather doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so much, but there&rsquo;s pretty good money
in it. He is going to let me have a small commission
on the tourist business, aside from a
fair salary. Makes it more interesting, and it
will do very well indeed until I have an opportunity
at something better. It will keep us going
until fall&mdash;when I can have the mail again&mdash;and
I hope will give us something to add to
the &lsquo;nest egg.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>They fell silent, Jack wondering how he could
get something really worth while to do, and
Desir&eacute; racking her brains to think of some way
in which she could contribute to their income.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s going to do the baking for the lunch
room?&rdquo; she asked suddenly, &ldquo;Jim hasn&rsquo;t a
wife or mother, has he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; but why do you want to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I might do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You! You have plenty to do now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not really, dear. The work here is very
easy, and Prissy is getting to be quite a help.
It wouldn&rsquo;t be at all hard to bake some cookies
and tarts, make sandwiches, and things like
that. I could make pies, using wild berries
which the children could gather. Oh, if Jim
Rutland is willing, say you&rsquo;ll let me try, Jack.
I&rsquo;ll bet you&rsquo;d have the most popular lunch room
in Nova Scotia! And think what it would mean,
with your commission!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt of its popularity after people
had once tasted the good things you can make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could spread my biscuits with jam, or
serve them hot with honey; and, oh, there would
be no end to the nice little things, all ready to
eat, that you could sell or serve.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>Desir&eacute;&rsquo;s imagination, fired by her enthusiasm,
supplied her with numerous ideas to be
put into practice if only Jack wouldn&rsquo;t object.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do let me try it, Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that you would overwork.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense. Of course I won&rsquo;t. I promise
to give it up if I feel that it&rsquo;s too much. But
I just <i>love</i> to cook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll speak to Jim tomorrow, if I get
a chance, and see what his plans are. Meanwhile,
I&rsquo;ve got to be ready to meet the bus at
seven-thirty in the morning; so let&rsquo;s go in.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">The big bus stopped at the end of the lane
promptly at seven-thirty each morning for a
week; then Jack announced one night that tomorrow
would be his last day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<h2 id="c28"><br />CHAPTER XXVIII
<br />A FIND</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry?&rdquo; asked Desir&eacute;, looking up from
the lettuce she was preparing for their supper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been pleasant,&rdquo; replied her brother,
selecting a radish from a dish on the table,
and beginning to eat it. &ldquo;George, the driver,
is a nice fellow, and we&rsquo;ve had some fun together;
but it&rsquo;s a kind of a lazy life, after all.
Of course somebody has to do it, but I think I
prefer more activity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen Jim yet about the baked
goods?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s hours had been so arranged that he
had been unable to stop at the Rutland General
Store.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ran across him this noon. He&rsquo;s tickled to
death over your ideas, and says he&rsquo;ll take
everything you can make, starting Thursday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desir&eacute; was delighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll just have to get rid of that horrid
dog,&rdquo; declared Priscilla, coming in at that moment,
about ready to cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s he done now?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He went and dug up all my nasturtiums.
He&rsquo;s always digging somewhere. He&rsquo;s a perfect
pest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look after him,&rdquo; said her brother, going
out to the garden.</p>
<p>He punished Rover, and, leaving Priscilla replanting
the remnants of her flowers, returned
to Desir&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say it before the children,&rdquo; said
Desir&eacute;, when Jack reported the condition of
Priscilla&rsquo;s garden, &ldquo;but Rover <i>has</i> a most unfortunate
passion for digging; and, as if he
knew that Priscilla disapproved of him, he usually
selects some part of her garden. I&rsquo;ve
whipped him two or three times, but back he
goes the next time the fancy strikes him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack laughed. &ldquo;I can imagine the kind of
beatings you give him. But,&rdquo; he added anxiously,
&ldquo;had you rather get rid of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; he&rsquo;s such a lovable animal that you
can&rsquo;t help being attached to him in spite of his
faults; and then, too, Ren&eacute; thinks the world of
him. It wouldn&rsquo;t be fair to take away his pet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following morning, just as the big bus
reached the lane, one of the tires exploded with
a loud report; and Jack had to help the driver
make repairs. The other Wistmores stood in
the shade of the trees, watching; even Desir&eacute;
could not resist the opportunity to see what
had to be done. There were a few passengers
already on board, and two or three of them got
out to stroll up and down the road.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What a darling house!&rdquo; exclaimed one
young lady, peering down the lane. &ldquo;Come
here, Dad; see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The grey-haired man looked in the direction
of her pointing finger, then at the little group
under the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You live here?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do you?&rdquo; said the lady, before Desir&eacute;
had hardly finished her affirmative reply; &ldquo;then
may we look at the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied the girl politely, although
she was far from willing to show it.</p>
<p>The man and woman examined the cabin both
inside and out, with keen interest; even the garden
was included in the inspection. Occasionally
they talked together in such low tones that
Desir&eacute; could not distinguish what they were
saying. She felt a queer sinking dread as she
followed them around. The children had stayed
near the bus, and it seemed as if she were
abandoned to these odd tourists.</p>
<p>On the stone doorstep the man turned back,
after they had gone over the place for the
second time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you own this?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who does?&rdquo; demanded the woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t belong to anybody, really,&rdquo; confessed
poor Desir&eacute; reluctantly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s something
about a title. We just live here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dad, buy it for me. I must have it!&rdquo;
exclaimed the young woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make inquiries, and&mdash;&rdquo; the man was
saying, when a loud blast from the horn summoned
them to the bus. They hurried down
the lane with a careless goodbye to the girl in
the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dissy,&rdquo; called Priscilla, running toward
her, closely followed by Ren&eacute; and Rover.
&ldquo;Why&mdash;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; as she noticed her
sister&rsquo;s pale face and unnatural manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just tired,&rdquo; Desir&eacute; managed to reply,
though such a storm of emotion surged within
her that she felt almost overcome by it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and lie down, and I&rsquo;ll do the dishes and
clean up,&rdquo; offered Priscilla. &ldquo;Ren&eacute;, take the
dog out to the garden and stay there until I
call you,&rdquo; she added importantly. &ldquo;Dissy&rsquo;s
going to take a nap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Priscilla dear,&rdquo; replied the girl
gratefully. &ldquo;I think I shall lie down. Call me
at eleven o&rsquo;clock. I shan&rsquo;t need anything until
then.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>Desir&eacute; kissed her little sister, escaped into
her room as quickly as possible, and closed the
door. In the privacy and quiet which she felt
she must have at all costs, she gave way to
tears. What would they do now? For these
rich people could get anything they set their
hearts on. Jack was right in warning her not
to get too fond of the place. She thought she
hadn&rsquo;t, but now when it was slipping slowly
but surely from their grasp&mdash;Oh! and Desir&eacute;
hid her face in the pillow to drown her sobs.</p>
<p>Presently she forced herself to grow calmer,
and when Priscilla quietly put her head in at
eleven o&rsquo;clock Desir&eacute;, pale, but outwardly composed,
was bathing her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was sweet of you to take care of things,
Prissy dear,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get dinner now;
I&rsquo;m quite all right. You run out-of-doors until
it&rsquo;s ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a searching look at her sister, the child
obeyed; but all the afternoon she kept making
excuses to come to the front yard, where Desir&eacute;
sat sewing, to see if she was all right. While
her sister was getting supper, Priscilla walked
down the lane to meet Jack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid there&rsquo;s something awful the
matter with Dissy, Jack,&rdquo; began the child, slipping
her hand into his. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not really sick&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t think&mdash;but she&rsquo;s not a bit like <i>her</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Jack quietly, for he had
heard bits of conversation on the bus that day,
and they gave him an advance inkling of Desir&eacute;&rsquo;s
trouble, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t say anything to her, or
let her know that you notice anything. I&rsquo;ll talk
to her tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t, Jack. I just helped all I could,
and stayed where she could call me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good girl; you&rsquo;re getting to be a
great help to us,&rdquo; tightening his grasp on her
brown, plump little hand.</p>
<p>Fortunately Ren&eacute; had a silly fit at the table,
and kept them all laughing in spite of themselves;
so the meal passed off without any constraint
or self-consciousness. After the children
were in bed, and the cabin in order for
the night, Jack drew Desir&eacute; out on the doorstep,
and, sitting down, beside her, put his arm
around her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now tell me all about it,&rdquo; he suggested
gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About what, Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever&rsquo;s troubling you. It&rsquo;s not fair to
keep me in the dark, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dropping her head on his broad shoulder,
she related, in disjointed sentences, the history
of the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guessed as much,&rdquo; he commented, as she
finished. &ldquo;I overheard their conversation on
the bus.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t they take it, if they don&rsquo;t mind not
having&mdash;having&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A clear title? I don&rsquo;t know, dear; I&rsquo;ll see
what I can find out from the judge tomorrow.
I should say, though, that we must not expect
to keep it. We talked of that possibility; don&rsquo;t
you remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but&mdash;such a thing seemed so&mdash;so very
improbable,&rdquo; faltered Desir&eacute;. &ldquo;The place had
been deserted for so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we have to give it up we can probably
find something in town. There&rsquo;s an old place
near Judge Herbine&rsquo;s, and another one on the
road to the Basin. Don&rsquo;t take it so to heart,
Dissy; we&rsquo;ll find a place somewhere, even if
we have to leave this; and we may not. It&rsquo;s
not like you to look on the dark side of things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cheered by Jack&rsquo;s words and manner, Desir&eacute;
began to feel that she had been foolish to let
herself become so disturbed, and she made a
heroic effort to resume her natural manner.
She succeeded so well that by bedtime they were
laughing over the discovery of Rover&rsquo;s latest
escapade, a hole dug beside the step on which
they were sitting. Jack set his foot in it as
they rose to go in, thereby nearly upsetting
himself and Desir&eacute; as well.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, by the way, Dissy,&rdquo; remarked Jack
after they had gone into the house, &ldquo;I almost
forgot to tell you something. You&rsquo;ll never guess
whom I saw today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then tell me right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My old enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack!&rdquo; cried Desir&eacute; fearfully.
&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the bus. He was on his way to work in
the orchards around Annapolis. He was rather
friendly, for him, and just as he was leaving
the bus, he thrust these into my hand and told
me to give them to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desir&eacute; peered curiously at the round, brown
things which her brother pulled out of his
pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some kind of bulbs. You&rsquo;d better plant
them tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use if we&rsquo;re going to lose the
place?&rdquo; she queried, rather bitterly.</p>
<p>Jack looked at her reprovingly. &ldquo;That
doesn&rsquo;t sound a bit like my cheerful partner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Jack. I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;ll plant
them tomorrow, and if we don&rsquo;t see them bloom,
perhaps they will give pleasure to someone
else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning she selected a lightly
shaded spot where the soil looked rich and
promising, and began to dig. Before long, her
spade struck a large stone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonder if I can get that out?&rdquo; she thought.
&ldquo;This is the best place in the yard for unknown
plants; for they&rsquo;ll get a mixture of sun and
shade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vigorously she attacked the stone, and after
much exertion succeeded in getting it out. Rolling
it carelessly to one side, she was busily trying
to smooth out the ragged, uneven earth
with the spade, when there was a sound of
metal striking on metal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; she called to her brother, who was
in the house reenforcing a shelf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wanted?&rdquo; he responded, sticking
his head out of the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here, quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Throwing his long legs over the sill, he
dropped onto the ground and was at her side
in a moment. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter,&rdquo; he asked;
&ldquo;snake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s down there,&rdquo; pointing to the
hole.</p>
<p>Jack seized the spade and quickly uncovered
an iron box. Desir&eacute; was trembling violently,
and could only gaze silently at the strange object.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you got?&rdquo; demanded Ren&eacute;, appearing
at that moment from the front yard.
&ldquo;Prissy!&rdquo; he shrieked, without waiting for an
answer, &ldquo;come &rsquo;n&rsquo; see!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>Priscilla appeared, viewed the find calmly,
and proposed taking it into the house to see
what it contained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think we had better take it over to
the judge&rsquo;s?&rdquo; asked Desir&eacute;, finally finding her
voice. &ldquo;Perhaps we should not open it by ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go right after him,&rdquo; declared Jack.
&ldquo;Just put some papers on the table so I can
carry the box in and set it down before I go.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c29"><br />CHAPTER XXIX
<br />W-17<sup>55</sup>&mdash;15x12&mdash;6754</h2>
<p>It seemed a long time before they heard the
sound of the Ford, but it was in reality only
about half an hour; for Jack had covered the
ground at his best speed, and the judge lost no
time in getting back with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Judge Herbine, darting into
the room and up to the table, &ldquo;lots of excitement.
Got anything to open it with, Jack? It&rsquo;s
locked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With considerable difficulty they managed to
force the lock, and pry up the cover. Then
everyone crowded around to peer inside. The
box was filled with gold and silver pieces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money!&rdquo; gasped Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried Desir&eacute;, &ldquo;it must have been out
there ever since the Expulsion. I read in my
little blue history that some of the Acadians
buried their savings in their gardens before
they left the country, because they expected to
come back again very soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it probably belonged to our ancestors,&rdquo;
said Jack slowly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s tip it out,&rdquo; proposed the judge. &ldquo;It
looks to me like a goodly sum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tarnished and dull, it lay in a heap on the
table; and as the judge turned the box right
side up again, he caught sight of some papers
in the bottom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Documents of some kind!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
loosening them carefully.</p>
<p>Stiff, yellow with age, the writing was dim
but discernible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a will, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; asked Jack, catching
sight of a few words at the top of the sheet,
as the man unfolded it slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. &lsquo;To my daughter, Desir&eacute; Godet
and her heirs forever&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo; he read. &ldquo;6754-1755.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; gasped Desir&eacute;, crowding closer to
look at the paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This house and money; and here&rsquo;s the missing
deed with the will. I congratulate you&mdash;most
heartily, children. This is evidently&mdash;a
perfectly legal will&mdash;and the long lost deed;
and since you are Godet survivors&mdash;the place
and the money must belong to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack!&rdquo; cried Desir&eacute;, throwing herself
into his arms, &ldquo;now you can go back to college,
and nobody can ever take this house away from
us. It is really our <i>home</i>, now, just as I always
felt it was.&rdquo; Desir&eacute; was sobbing in her delirium
of joy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;N&rsquo; is all that money ours?&rdquo; demanded
Ren&eacute;, staring at it with wide eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess it is, my boy,&rdquo; replied the judge,
adding to Jack, &ldquo;And some of these are doubtless
rare pieces&mdash;worth much more than their
intrinsic value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we can have an automobile,&rdquo; pronounced
Ren&eacute;.</p>
<p>Everybody laughed, and the tension was
somewhat relieved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Jack,&rdquo; said Desir&eacute;, &ldquo;there are two
of the numbers from that slip of paper that
was in Father&rsquo;s box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; inquired the judge, whirling
around like a top.</p>
<p>Desir&eacute; explained while Jack got the paper
and they all examined it carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;1755 is the year,&rdquo; decided the judge, &ldquo;and
6754 the number of the deed; but&mdash;Wait a
minute; I have an idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Out into the garden he hurried, followed by
the whole family. With the hole as a base, he
measured and calculated, while the others
watched silently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it!&rdquo; he exclaimed at last. &ldquo;<i>W</i> means
west of the house; <i>15</i> is the depth of the hole,
and <i>12</i> the distance from the edge of the lot.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The mystery is solved at last!&rdquo; exulted
Desir&eacute;.</p>
<p class="tb">Several weeks later the ownership of the
little cabin was formally handed over to the
Wistmores, under the guardianship of Judge
Herbine, and their little fortune duly deposited
to their credit, ready for the fall when Jack
was to go to college, and Desir&eacute; to high school.</p>
